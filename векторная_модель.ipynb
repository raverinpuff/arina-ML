              "'Part One\\nI\\nMOTHER died today. Or, maybe, yesterday; I can’t be sure. The telegram from the\\nHome says: YOUR MOTHER PASSED AWAY. FUNERAL TOMORROW. DEEP\\nSYMPATHY. Which leaves the matter doubtful; it could have been yesterday.\\nThe Home for Aged Persons is at Marengo, some fifty miles from Algiers. With\\nthe two o’clock bus I should get there well before nightfall. Then I can spend the\\nnight there, keeping the usual vigil beside the body, and be back here by tomorrow\\nevening. I have fixed up with my employer for two days’ leave; obviously, under the\\ncircumstances, he couldn’t refuse. Still, I had an idea he looked annoyed, and I said,\\nwithout thinking: “Sorry, sir, but it’s not my fault, you know.”\\nAfterwards it struck me I needn’t have said that. I had no reason to excuse myself;\\nit was up to him to express his sympathy and so forth. Probably he will do so the day\\nafter tomorrow, when he sees me in black. For the present, it’s almost as if Mother\\nweren’t really dead. The funeral will bring it home to me, put an official seal on it, so\\nto speak. ...\\nI took the two-o’clock bus. It was a blazing hot afternoon. I’d lunched, as usual, at\\nCéleste’s restaurant. Everyone was most kind, and Céleste said to me, “There’s no\\none like a mother.” When I left they came with me to the door. It was something of a\\nrush, getting away, as at the last moment I had to call in at Emmanuel’s place to\\nborrow his black tie and mourning band. He lost his uncle a few months ago.\\nI had to run to catch the bus. I suppose it was my hurrying like that, what with the\\nglare off the road and from the sky, the reek of gasoline, and the jolts, that made me\\nfeel so drowsy. Anyhow, I slept most of the way. When I woke I was leaning against\\na soldier; he grinned and asked me if I’d come from a long way off, and I just\\nnodded, to cut things short. I wasn’t in a mood for talking.\\nThe Home is a little over a mile from the village. I went there on foot. I asked to\\nbe allowed to see Mother at once, but the doorkeeper told me I must see the warden\\nfirst. He wasn’t free, and I had to wait a bit. The doorkeeper chatted with me while I\\nwaited; then he led me to the office. The warden was a very small man, with gray\\nhair, and a Legion of Honor rosette in his buttonhole. He gave me a long look with\\nhis watery blue eyes. Then we shook hands, and he held mine so long that I began to\\nfeel embarrassed. After that he consulted a register on his table, and said:\\n“Madame Meursault entered the Home three years ago. She had no private means\\nand depended entirely on you.”\\n4\\n\\n\\n\\nI had a feeling he was blaming me for something, and started to explain. But he\\ncut me short.\\n“There’s no need to excuse yourself, my boy. I’ve looked up the record and\\nobviously you weren’t in a position to see that she was properly cared for. She\\nneeded someone to be with her all the time, and young men in jobs like yours don’t\\nget too much pay. In any case, she was much happier in the Home.”\\nI said, “Yes, sir; I’m sure of that.”\\nThen he added: “She had good friends here, you know, old folks like herself, and\\none gets on better with people of one’s own generation. You’re much too young; you\\ncouldn’t have been much of a companion to her.”\\nThat was so. When we lived together, Mother was always watching me, but we\\nhardly ever talked. During her first few weeks at the Home she used to cry a good\\ndeal. But that was only because she hadn’t settled down. After a month or two she’d\\nhave cried if she’d been told to leave the Home. Because this, too, would have been a\\nwrench. That was why, during the last year, I seldom went to see her. Also, it would\\nhave meant losing my Sunday—not to mention the trouble of going to the bus,\\ngetting my ticket, and spending two hours on the journey each way.\\nThe warden went on talking, but I didn’t pay much attention. Finally he said:\\n“Now, I suppose you’d like to see your mother?”\\nI rose without replying, and he led the way to the door. As we were going down\\nthe stairs he explained:\\n“I’ve had the body moved to our little mortuary—so as not to upset the other old\\npeople, you understand. Every time there’s a death here, they’re in a nervous state for\\ntwo or three days. Which means, of course, extra work and worry for our staff.”\\nWe crossed a courtyard where there were a number of old men, talking amongst\\nthemselves in little groups. They fell silent as we came up with them. Then, behind\\nour backs, the chattering began again. Their voices reminded me of parakeets in a\\ncage, only the sound wasn’t quite so shrill. The warden stopped outside the entrance\\nof a small, low building.\\n“So here I leave you, Monsieur Meursault. If you want me for anything, you’ll\\nfind me in my office. We propose to have the funeral tomorrow morning. That will\\nenable you to spend the night beside your mother’s coffin, as no doubt you would\\nwish to do. Just one more thing; I gathered from your mother’s friends that she\\nwished to be buried with the rites of the Church. I’ve made arrangements for this; but\\nI thought I should let you know.”\\nI thanked him. So far as I knew, my mother, though not a professed atheist, had\\nnever given a thought to religion in her life.\\nI entered the mortuary. It was a bright, spotlessly clean room, with whitewashed\\nwalls and a big skylight. The furniture consisted of some chairs and trestles. Two of\\nthe latter stood open in the center of the room and the coffin rested on them. The lid\\n5\\n\\n\\n\\nwas in place, but the screws had been given only a few turns and their nickeled heads\\nstuck out above the wood, which was stained dark walnut. An Arab woman—a\\nnurse, I supposed—was sitting beside the bier; she was wearing a blue smock and\\nhad a rather gaudy scarf wound round her hair.\\nJust then the keeper came up behind me. He’d evidently been running, as he was a\\nlittle out of breath.\\n“We put the lid on, but I was told to unscrew it when you came, so that you could\\nsee her.”\\nWhile he was going up to the coffin I told him not to trouble.\\n“Eh? What’s that?” he exclaimed. “You don’t want me to ...?”\\n“No,” I said.\\nHe put back the screwdriver in his pocket and stared at me. I realized then that I\\nshouldn’t have said, “No,” and it made me rather embarrassed. After eying me for\\nsome moments he asked:\\n“Why not?” But he didn’t sound reproachful; he simply wanted to know.\\n“Well, really I couldn’t say,” I answered.\\nHe began twiddling his white mustache; then, without looking at me, said gently:\\n“I understand.”\\nHe was a pleasant-looking man, with blue eyes and ruddy cheeks. He drew up a\\nchair for me near the coffin, and seated himself just behind. The nurse got up and\\nmoved toward the door. As she was going by, the keeper whispered in my ear:\\n“It’s a tumor she has, poor thing.”\\nI looked at her more carefully and I noticed that she had a bandage round her head,\\njust below her eyes. It lay quite flat across the bridge of her nose, and one saw hardly\\nanything of her face except that strip of whiteness.\\nAs soon as she had gone, the keeper rose.\\n“Now I’ll leave you to yourself.”\\nI don’t know whether I made some gesture, but instead of going he halted behind\\nmy chair. The sensation of someone posted at my back made me uncomfortable. The\\nsun was getting low and the whole room was flooded with a pleasant, mellow light.\\nTwo hornets were buzzing overhead, against the skylight. I was so sleepy I could\\nhardly keep my eyes open. Without looking round, I asked the keeper how long he’d\\nbeen at the Home. “Five years.” The answer came so pat that one could have thought\\nhe’d been expecting my question.\\nThat started him off, and he became quite chatty. If anyone had told him ten years\\nago that he’d end his days as doorkeeper at a home at Marengo, he’d never have\\nbelieved it. He was sixty-four, he said, and hailed from Paris.\\nWhen he said that, I broke in. “Ah, you don’t come from here?”\\nI remembered then that, before taking me to the warden, he’d told me something\\nabout Mother. He had said she’d have to be buried mighty quickly because of the\\n6\\n\\n\\n\\nheat in these parts, especially down in the plain. “At Paris they keep the body for\\nthree days, sometimes four.” After that he had mentioned that he’d spent the best part\\nof his life in Paris, and could never manage to forget it. “Here,” he had said, “things\\nhave to go with a rush, like. You’ve hardly time to get used to the idea that\\nsomeone’s dead, before you’re hauled off to the funeral.” “That’s enough,” his wife\\nhad put in. “You didn’t ought to say such things to the poor young gentleman.” The\\nold fellow had blushed and begun to apologize. I told him it was quite all right. As a\\nmatter of fact, I found it rather interesting, what he’d been telling me; I hadn’t\\nthought of that before.\\nNow he went on to say that he’d entered the Home as an ordinary inmate. But he\\nwas still quite hale and hearty, and when the keeper’s job fell vacant, he offered to\\ntake it on.\\nI pointed out that, even so, he was really an inmate like the others, but he wouldn’t\\nhear of it. He was “an official, like.” I’d been struck before by his habit of saying\\n“they” or, less often, “them old folks,” when referring to inmates no older than\\nhimself. Still, I could see his point of view. As doorkeeper he had a certain standing,\\nand some authority over the rest of them.\\nJust then the nurse returned. Night had fallen very quickly; all of a sudden, it\\nseemed, the sky went black above the skylight. The keeper switched on the lamps,\\nand I was almost blinded by the blaze of light.\\nHe suggested I should go to the refectory for dinner, but I wasn’t hungry. Then he\\nproposed bringing me a mug of café au lait. As I am very partial to café au lait I\\nsaid, “Thanks,” and a few minutes later he came back with a tray. I drank the coffee,\\nand then I wanted a cigarette. But I wasn’t sure if I should smoke, under the\\ncircumstances—in Mother’s presence. I thought it over; really, it didn’t seem to\\nmatter, so I offered the keeper a cigarette, and we both smoked.\\nAfter a while he started talking again.\\n“You know, your mother’s friends will be coming soon, to keep vigil with you\\nbeside the body. We always have a ‘vigil’ here, when anyone dies. I’d better go and\\nget some chairs and a pot of black coffee.”\\nThe glare off the white walls was making my eyes smart, and I asked him if he\\ncouldn’t turn off one of the lamps. “Nothing doing,” he said. They’d arranged the\\nlights like that; either one had them all on or none at all. After that I didn’t pay much\\nmore attention to him. He went out, brought some chairs, and set them out round the\\ncoffin. On one he placed a coffeepot and ten or a dozen cups. Then he sat down\\nfacing me, on the far side of Mother. The nurse was at the other end of the room,\\nwith her back to me. I couldn’t see what she was doing, but by the way her arms\\nmoved I guessed that she was knitting. I was feeling very comfortable; the coffee had\\nwarmed me up, and through the open door came scents of flowers and breaths of\\ncool night air. I think I dozed off for a while.\\n7\\n\\n\\n\\nI was wakened by an odd rustling in my ears. After having had my eyes closed, I\\nhad a feeling that the light had grown even stronger than before. There wasn’t a trace\\nof shadow anywhere, and every object, each curve or angle, seemed to score its\\noutline on one’s eyes. The old people, Mother’s friends, were coming in. I counted\\nten in all, gliding almost soundlessly through the bleak white glare. None of the\\nchairs creaked when they sat down. Never in my life had I seen anyone so clearly as\\nI saw these people; not a detail of their clothes or features escaped me. And yet I\\ncouldn’t hear them, and it was hard to believe they really existed.\\nNearly all the women wore aprons, and the strings drawn tight round their waists\\nmade their big stomachs bulge still more. I’d never yet noticed what big paunches\\nold women usually have. Most of the men, however, were as thin as rakes, and they\\nall carried sticks. What struck me most about their faces was that one couldn’t see\\ntheir eyes, only a dull glow in a sort of nest of wrinkles.\\nOn sitting down, they looked at me, and wagged their heads awkwardly, their lips\\nsucked in between their toothless gums. I couldn’t decide if they were greeting me\\nand trying to say something, or if it was due to some infirmity of age. I inclined to\\nthink that they were greeting me, after their fashion, but it had a queer effect, seeing\\nall those old fellows grouped round the keeper, solemnly eying me and dandling their\\nheads from side to side. For a moment I had an absurd impression that they had come\\nto sit in judgment on me.\\nA few minutes later one of the women started weeping. She was in the second row\\nand I couldn’t see her face because of another woman in front. At regular intervals\\nshe emitted a little choking sob; one had a feeling she would never stop. The others\\ndidn’t seem to notice. They sat in silence, slumped in their chairs, staring at the\\ncoffin or at their walking sticks or any object just in front of them, and never took\\ntheir eyes off it. And still the woman sobbed. I was rather surprised, as I didn’t know\\nwho she was. I wanted her to stop crying, but dared not speak to her. After a while\\nthe keeper bent toward her and whispered in her ear; but she merely shook her head,\\nmumbled something I couldn’t catch, and went on sobbing as steadily as before.\\nThe keeper got up and moved his chair beside mine. At first he kept silent; then,\\nwithout looking at me, he explained.\\n“She was devoted to your mother. She says your mother was her only friend in the\\nworld, and now she’s all alone.”\\nI had nothing to say, and the silence lasted quite a while. Presently the woman’s\\nsighs and sobs became less frequent, and, after blowing her nose and snuffling for\\nsome minutes, she, too, fell silent.\\nI’d ceased feeling sleepy, but I was very tired and my legs were aching badly. And\\nnow I realized that the silence of these people was telling on my nerves. The only\\nsound was a rather queer one; it came only now and then, and at first I was puzzled\\nby it. However, after listening attentively, I guessed what it was; the old men were\\n8\\n\\n\\n\\nsucking at the insides of their cheeks, and this caused the odd, wheezing noises that\\nhad mystified me. They were so much absorbed in their thoughts that they didn’t\\nknow what they were up to. I even had an impression that the dead body in their\\nmidst meant nothing at all to them. But now I suspect that I was mistaken about this.\\nWe all drank the coffee, which the keeper handed round. After that, I can’t\\nremember much; somehow the night went by. I can recall only one moment; I had\\nopened my eyes and I saw the old men sleeping hunched up on their chairs, with one\\nexception. Resting his chin on his hands clasped round his stick, he was staring hard\\nat me, as if he had been waiting for me to wake. Then I fell asleep again. I woke up\\nafter a bit, because the ache in my legs had developed into a sort of cramp.\\nThere was a glimmer of dawn above the skylight. A minute or two later one of the\\nold men woke up and coughed repeatedly. He spat into a big check handkerchief, and\\neach time he spat it sounded as if he were retching. This woke the others, and the\\nkeeper told them it was time to make a move. They all got up at once. Their faces\\nwere ashen gray after the long, uneasy vigil. To my surprise each of them shook\\nhands with me, as though this night together, in which we hadn’t exchanged a word,\\nhad created a kind of intimacy between us.\\nI was quite done in. The keeper took me to his room, and I tidied myself up a bit.\\nHe gave me some more “white” coffee, and it seemed to do me good. When I went\\nout, the sun was up and the sky mottled red above the hills between Marengo and the\\nsea. A morning breeze was blowing and it had a pleasant salty tang. There was the\\npromise of a very fine day. I hadn’t been in the country for ages, and I caught myself\\nthinking what an agreeable walk I could have had, if it hadn’t been for Mother.\\nAs it was, I waited in the courtyard, under a plane tree. I sniffed the smells of the\\ncool earth and found I wasn’t sleepy any more. Then I thought of the other fellows in\\nthe office. At this hour they’d be getting up, preparing to go to work; for me this was\\nalways the worst hour of the day. I went on thinking, like this, for ten minutes or so;\\nthen the sound of a bell inside the building attracted my attention. I could see\\nmovements behind the windows; then all was calm again. The sun had risen a little\\nhigher and was beginning to warm my feet. The keeper came across the yard and\\nsaid the warden wished to see me. I went to his office and he got me to sign some\\ndocument. I noticed that he was in black, with pin-stripe trousers. He picked up the\\ntelephone receiver and looked at me.\\n“The undertaker’s men arrived some moments ago, and they will be going to the\\nmortuary to screw down the coffin. Shall I tell them to wait, for you to have a last\\nglimpse of your mother?”\\n“No,” I said.\\nHe spoke into the receiver, lowering his voice. “That’s all right, Figeac. Tell the\\nmen to go there now.”\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\n\\nHe then informed me that he was going to attend the funeral, and I thanked him.\\nSitting down behind his desk, he crossed his short legs and leaned back. Besides the\\nnurse on duty, he told me, he and I would be the only mourners at the funeral. It was\\na rule of the Home that inmates shouldn’t attend funerals, though there was no\\nobjection to letting some of them sit up beside the coffin, the night before.\\n“It’s for their own sakes,” he explained, “to spare their feelings. But in this\\nparticular instance I’ve given permission to an old friend of your mother to come\\nwith us. His name is Thomas Pérez.” The warden smiled. “It’s a rather touching little\\nstory in its way. He and your mother had become almost inseparable. The other old\\npeople used to tease Pérez about having a fiancée. ‘When are you going to marry\\nher?’ they’d ask. He’d turn it with a laugh. It was a standing joke, in fact. So, as you\\ncan guess, he feels very badly about your mother’s death. I thought I couldn’t\\ndecently refuse him permission to attend the funeral. But, on our medical officer’s\\nadvice, I forbade him to sit up beside the body last night.”\\nFor some time we sat there without speaking. Then the warden got up and went to\\nthe window. Presently he said:\\n“Ah, there’s the padre from Marengo. He’s a bit ahead of time.”\\nHe warned me that it would take us a good three quarters of an hour, walking to\\nthe church, which was in the village. Then we went downstairs.\\nThe priest was waiting just outside the mortuary door. With him were two\\nacolytes, one of whom had a censer. The priest was stooping over him, adjusting the\\nlength of the silver chain on which it hung. When he saw us he straightened up and\\nsaid a few words to me, addressing me as, “My son.” Then he led the way into the\\nmortuary.\\nI noticed at once that four men in black were standing behind the coffin and the\\nscrews in the lid had now been driven home. At the same moment I heard the warden\\nremark that the hearse had arrived, and the priest starting his prayers. Then\\neverybody made a move. Holding a strip of black cloth, the four men approached the\\ncoffin, while the priest, the boys, and myself filed out. A lady I hadn’t seen before\\nwas standing by the door. “This is Monsieur Meursault,” the warden said to her. I\\ndidn’t catch her name, but I gathered she was a nursing sister attached to the Home.\\nWhen I was introduced, she bowed, without the trace of a smile on her long, gaunt\\nface. We stood aside from the doorway to let the coffin by; then, following the\\nbearers down a corridor, we came to the front entrance, where a hearse was waiting.\\nOblong, glossy, varnished black all over, it vaguely reminded me of the pen trays in\\nthe office.\\nBeside the hearse stood a quaintly dressed little -man, whose duty it was, I\\nunderstood, to supervise the funeral, as a sort of master of ceremonies. Near him,\\nlooking constrained, almost bashful, was old M. Pérez, my mother’s special friend.\\nHe wore a soft felt hat with a pudding-basin crown and a very wide brim—he\\n10\\n\\n\\n\\nwhisked it off the moment the coffin emerged from the doorway—trousers that\\nconcertina’d on his shoes, a black tie much too small for his high white double collar.\\nUnder a bulbous, pimply nose, his lips were trembling. But what caught my attention\\nmost was his ears; pendulous, scarlet ears that showed up like blobs of sealing wax\\non the pallor of his cheeks and were framed in wisps of silky white hair.\\nThe undertaker’s factotum shepherded us to our places, with the priest in front of\\nthe hearse, and the four men in black on each side of it. The warden and myself came\\nnext, and, bringing up the rear, old Pérez and the nurse.\\nThe sky was already a blaze of light, and the air stoking up rapidly. I felt the first\\nwaves of heat lapping my back, and my dark suit made things worse. I couldn’t\\nimagine why we waited so long for getting under way. Old Pérez, who had put on his\\nhat, took it off again. I had turned slightly in his direction and was looking at him\\nwhen the warden started telling me more about him. I remember his saying that old\\nPérez and my mother used often to have a longish stroll together in the cool of the\\nevening; sometimes they went as far as the village, accompanied by a nurse, of\\ncourse.\\nI looked at the countryside, at the long lines of cypresses sloping up toward the\\nskyline and the hills, the hot red soil dappled with vivid green, and here and there a\\nlonely house sharply outlined against the light—and I could understand Mother’s\\nfeelings. Evenings in these parts must be a sort of mournful solace. Now, in the full\\nglare of the morning sun, with everything shimmering in the heat haze, there was\\nsomething inhuman, discouraging, about this landscape.\\nAt last we made a move. Only then I noticed that Pérez had a slight limp. The old\\nchap steadily lost ground as the hearse gained speed. One of the men beside it, too,\\nfell back and drew level with me. I was surprised to see how quickly the sun was\\nclimbing up the sky, and just then it struck me that for quite a while the air had been\\nthrobbing with the hum of insects and the rustle of grass warming up. Sweat was\\nrunning down my face. As I had no hat I tried to fan myself with my handkerchief.\\nThe undertaker’s man turned to me and said something that I didn’t catch. At that\\nsame time he wiped the crown of his head with a handkerchief that he held in his left\\nhand, while with his right he tilted up his hat. I asked him what he’d said. He pointed\\nupward.\\n“Sun’s pretty bad today, ain’t it?”\\n“Yes,” I said.\\nAfter a while he asked: “Is it your mother we’re burying?”\\n“Yes,” I said again.\\n“What was her age?”\\n“Well, she was getting on.” As a matter of fact, I didn’t know exactly how old she\\nwas.\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter that he kept silent. Looking back, I saw Pérez limping along some fifty yards\\nbehind. He was swinging his big felt hat at arm’s length, trying to make the pace. I\\nalso had a look at the warden. He was walking with carefully measured steps,\\neconomizing every gesture. Beads of perspiration glistened on his forehead, but he\\ndidn’t wipe them off.\\nI had an impression that our little procession was moving slightly faster. Wherever\\nI looked I saw the same sun-drenched countryside, and the sky was so dazzling that I\\ndared not raise my eyes. Presently we struck a patch of freshly tarred road. A\\nshimmer of heat played over it and one’s feet squelched at each step, leaving bright\\nblack gashes. In front, the coachman’s glossy black hat looked like a lump of the\\nsame sticky substance, poised above the hearse. It gave one a queer, dreamlike\\nimpression, that blue-white glare overhead and all this blackness round one: the sleek\\nblack of the hearse, the dull black of the men’s clothes, and the silvery-black gashes\\nin the road. And then there were the smells, smells of hot leather and horse dung\\nfrom the hearse, veined with whiffs of incense smoke. What with these and the\\nhangover from a poor night’s sleep, I found my eyes and thoughts growing blurred.\\nI looked back again. Pérez seemed very far away now, almost hidden by the heat\\nhaze; then, abruptly, he disappeared altogether. After puzzling over it for a bit, I\\nguessed that he had turned off the road into the fields. Then I noticed that there was a\\nbend of the road a little way ahead. Obviously Pérez, who knew the district well, had\\ntaken a short cut, so as to catch up with us. He rejoined us soon after we were round\\nthe bend; then began to lose ground again. He took another short cut and met us\\nagain farther on; in fact, this happened several times during the next half-hour. But\\nsoon I lost interest in his movements; my temples were throbbing and I could hardly\\ndrag myself along.\\nAfter that everything went with a rush; and also with such precision and matter-offactness that I remember hardly any details. Except that when we were on the\\noutskirts of the village the nurse said something to me. Her voice took me by\\nsurprise; it didn’t match her face at all; it was musical and slightly tremulous. What\\nshe said was: “If you go too slowly there’s the risk of a heatstroke. But, if you go too\\nfast, you perspire, and the cold air in the church gives you a chill.” I saw her point;\\neither way one was in for it.\\nSome other memories of the funeral have stuck in my mind. The old boy’s face,\\nfor instance, when he caught up with us for the last time, just outside the village. His\\neyes were streaming with tears, of exhaustion or distress, or both together. But\\nbecause of the wrinkles they couldn’t flow down. They spread out, crisscrossed, and\\nformed a smooth gloss on the old, worn face.\\nAnd I can remember the look of the church, the villagers in the street, the red\\ngeraniums on the graves, Pérez’s fainting fit—he crumpled up like a rag doll—the\\ntawny-red earth pattering on Mother’s coffin, the bits of white roots mixed up with it;\\n12\\n\\n\\n\\nthen more people, voices, the wait outside a café for the bus, the rumble of the\\nengine, and my little thrill of pleasure when we entered the first brightly lit streets of\\nAlgiers, and I pictured myself going straight to bed and sleeping twelve hours at a\\nstretch.\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\nON WAKING I understood why my employer had looked rather cross when I asked\\nfor my two days off; it’s a Saturday today. I hadn’t thought of this at the time; it only\\nstruck me when I was getting out of bed. Obviously he had seen that it would mean\\nmy getting four days’ holiday straight off, and one couldn’t expect him to like that.\\nStill, for one thing, it wasn’t my fault if Mother was buried yesterday and not today;\\nand then, again, I’d have had my Saturday and Sunday off in any case. But naturally\\nthis didn’t prevent me from seeing my employer’s point.\\nGetting up was an effort, as I’d been really exhausted by the previous day’s\\nexperiences. While shaving, I wondered how to spend the morning, and decided that\\na swim would do me good. So I caught the streetcar that goes down to the harbor.\\nIt was quite like old times; a lot of young people were in the swimming pool,\\namongst them Marie Cardona, who used to be a typist at the office. I was rather keen\\non her in those days, and I fancy she liked me, too. But she was with us so short a\\ntime that nothing came of it.\\nWhile I was helping her to climb on to a raft, I let my hand stray over her breasts.\\nThen she lay flat on the raft, while I trod water. After a moment she turned and\\nlooked at me. Her hair was over her eyes and she was laughing. I clambered up on to\\nthe raft, beside her. The air was pleasantly warm, and, half jokingly, I let my head\\nsink back upon her lap. She didn’t seem to mind, so I let it stay there. I had the sky\\nfull in my eyes, all blue and gold, and I could feel Marie’s stomach rising and falling\\ngently under my head. We must have stayed a good half-hour on the raft, both of us\\nhalf asleep. When the sun got too hot she dived off and I followed. I caught up with\\nher, put my arm round her waist, and we swam side by side. She was still laughing.\\nWhile we were drying ourselves on the edge of the swimming pool she said: “I’m\\nbrowner than you.” I asked her if she’d come to the movies with me that evening.\\nShe laughed again and said, “Yes,” if I’d take her to the comedy everybody was\\ntalking about, the one with Fernandel in it.\\nWhen we had dressed, she stared at my black tie and asked if I was in mourning. I\\nexplained that my mother had died. “When?” she asked, and I said, “Yesterday.” She\\nmade no remark, though I thought she shrank away a little. I was just going to\\nexplain to her that it wasn’t my fault, but I checked myself, as I remembered having\\nsaid the same thing to my employer, and realizing then it sounded rather foolish.\\nStill, foolish or not, somehow one can’t help feeling a bit guilty, I suppose.\\nAnyhow, by evening Marie had forgotten all about it. The film was funny in parts,\\nbut some of it was downright stupid. She pressed her leg against mine while we were\\nin the picture house, and I was fondling her breast. Toward the end of the show I\\nkissed her, but rather clumsily. Afterward she came back with me to my place.\\n14\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I woke up, Marie had gone. She’d told me her aunt expected her first thing\\nin the morning. I remembered it was a Sunday, and that put me off; I’ve never cared\\nfor Sundays. So I turned my head and lazily sniffed the smell of brine that Marie’s\\nhead had left on the pillow. I slept until ten. After that I stayed in bed until noon,\\nsmoking cigarettes. I decided not to lunch at Céleste’s restaurant as I usually did;\\nthey’d be sure to pester me with questions, and I dislike being questioned. So I fried\\nsome eggs and ate them off the pan. I did without bread as there wasn’t any left, and\\nI couldn’t be bothered going down to buy it.\\nAfter lunch I felt at loose ends and roamed about the little flat. It suited us well\\nenough when Mother was with me, but now that I was by myself it was too large and\\nI’d moved the dining table into my bedroom. That was now the only room I used; it\\nhad all the furniture I needed: a brass bedstead, a dressing table, some cane chairs\\nwhose seats had more or less caved in, a wardrobe with a tarnished mirror. The rest\\nof the flat was never used, so I didn’t trouble to look after it.\\nA bit later, for want of anything better to do, I picked up an old newspaper that\\nwas lying on the floor and read it. There was an advertisement of Kruschen Salts and\\nI cut it out and pasted in into an album where I keep things that amuse me in the\\npapers. Then I washed my hands and, as a last resource, went out on to the balcony.\\nMy bedroom overlooks the main street of our district. Though it was a fine\\nafternoon, the paving blocks were black and glistening. What few people were about\\nseemed in an absurd hurry. First of all there came a family, going for their Sundayafternoon walk; two small boys in sailor suits, with short trousers hardly down to\\ntheir knees, and looking rather uneasy in their Sunday best; then a little girl with a\\nbig pink bow and black patent-leather shoes. Behind them was their mother, an\\nenormously fat woman in a brown silk dress, and their father, a dapper little man,\\nwhom I knew by sight. He had a straw hat, a walking stick, and a butterfly tie. Seeing\\nhim beside his wife, I understood why people said he came of a good family and had\\nmarried beneath him.\\nNext came a group of young fellows, the local “bloods,” with sleek oiled hair, red\\nties, coats cut very tight at the waist, braided pockets, and square-toed shoes. I\\nguessed they were going to one of the big theaters in the center of the town. That was\\nwhy they had started out so early and were hurrying to the streetcar stop, laughing\\nand talking at the top of their voices.\\nAfter they had passed, the street gradually emptied. By this time all the matinees\\nmust have begun. Only a few shopkeepers and cats remained about. Above the\\nsycamores bordering the road the sky was cloudless, but the light was soft. The\\ntobacconist on the other side of the street brought a chair out on to the pavement in\\nfront of his door and sat astride it, resting his arms on the back. The streetcars which\\na few minutes before had been crowded were now almost empty. In the little café,\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\n\\nChez Pierrot, beside the tobacconist’s, the waiter was sweeping up the sawdust in the\\nempty restaurant. A typical Sunday afternoon. ...\\nI turned my chair round and seated myself like the tobacconist, as it was more\\ncomfortable that way. After smoking a couple of cigarettes I went back to the room,\\ngot a tablet of chocolate, and returned to the window to eat it. Soon after, the sky\\nclouded over, and I thought a summer storm was coming. However, the clouds\\ngradually lifted. All the same, they had left in the street a sort of threat of rain, which\\nmade it darker. I stayed watching the sky for quite a while.\\nAt five there was a loud clanging of streetcars. They were coming from the\\nstadium in our suburb where there had been a football match. Even the back\\nplatforms were crowded and people were standing on the steps. Then another\\nstreetcar brought back the teams. I knew they were the players by the little suitcase\\neach man carried. They were bawling out their team song, “Keep the ball rolling,\\nboys.” One of them looked up at me and shouted, “We licked them!” I waved my\\nhand and called back, “Good work!” From now on there was a steady stream of\\nprivate cars.\\nThe sky had changed again; a reddish glow was spreading up beyond the\\nhousetops. As dusk set in, the street grew more crowded. People were returning from\\ntheir walks, and I noticed the dapper little man with the fat wife amongst the passersby. Children were whimpering and trailing wearily after their parents. After some\\nminutes the local picture houses disgorged their audiences. I noticed that the young\\nfellows coming from them were taking longer strides and gesturing more vigorously\\nthan at ordinary times; doubtless the picture they’d been seeing was of the wild-West\\nvariety. Those who had been to the picture houses in the middle of the town came a\\nlittle later, and looked more sedate, though a few were still laughing. On the whole,\\nhowever, they seemed languid and exhausted. Some of them remained loitering in\\nthe street under my window. A group of girls came by, walking arm in arm. The\\nyoung men under my window swerved so as to brush against them, and shouted\\nhumorous remarks, which made the girls turn their heads and giggle. I recognized\\nthem as girls from my part of the town, and two or three of them, whom I knew,\\nlooked up and waved to me.\\nJust then the street lamps came on, all together, and they made the stars that were\\nbeginning to glimmer in the night sky paler still. I felt my eyes getting tired, what\\nwith the lights and all the movement I’d been watching in the street. There were little\\npools of brightness under the lamps, and now and then a streetcar passed, lighting up\\na girl’s hair, or a smile, or a silver bangle.\\nSoon after this, as the streetcars became fewer and the sky showed velvety black\\nabove the trees and lamps, the street grew emptier, almost imperceptibly, until a time\\ncame when there was nobody to be seen and a cat, the first of the evening, crossed,\\nunhurrying, the deserted street.\\n16\\n\\n\\n\\nIt struck me that I’d better see about some dinner. I had been leaning so long on\\nthe back of my chair, looking down, that my neck hurt when I straightened myself\\nup. I went down, bought some bread and spaghetti, did my cooking, and ate my meal\\nstanding. I’d intended to smoke another cigarette at my window, but the night had\\nturned rather chilly and I decided against it. As I was coming back, after shutting the\\nwindow, I glanced at the mirror and saw reflected in it a corner of my table with my\\nspirit lamp and some bits of bread beside it. It occurred to me that somehow I’d got\\nthrough another Sunday, that Mother now was buried, and tomorrow I’d be going\\nback to work as usual. Really, nothing in my life had changed.\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\nI HAD a busy morning in the office. My employer was in a good humor. He even\\ninquired if I wasn’t too tired, and followed it up by asking what Mother’s age was. I\\nthought a bit, then answered, “Round about sixty,” as I didn’t want to make a\\nblunder. At which he looked relieved—why, I can’t imagine—and seemed to think\\nthat closed the matter.\\nThere was a pile of bills of lading waiting on my desk, and I had to go through\\nthem all. Before leaving for lunch I washed my hands. I always enjoyed doing this at\\nmidday. In the evening it was less pleasant, as the roller towel, after being used by so\\nmany people, was sopping wet. I once brought this to my employer’s notice. It was\\nregrettable, he agreed—but, to his mind, a mere detail. I left the office building a\\nlittle later than usual, at half-past twelve, with Emmanuel, who works in the\\nForwarding Department. Our building overlooks the sea, and we paused for a\\nmoment on the steps to look at the shipping in the. harbor. The sun was scorching\\nhot. Just then a big truck came up, with a din of chains and backfires from the\\nengine, and Emmanuel suggested we should try to jump it. I started to run. The truck\\nwas well away, and we had to chase it for quite a distance. What with the heat and\\nthe noise from the engine, I felt half dazed. All I was conscious of was our mad rush\\nalong the water front, amongst cranes and winches, with dark hulls of ships alongside\\nand masts swaying in the offing. I was the first to catch up with the truck. I took a\\nflying jump, landed safely, and helped Emmanuel to scramble in beside me. We were\\nboth of us out of breath, and the bumps of the truck on the roughly laid cobbles made\\nthings worse. Emmanuel chuckled, and panted in my ear, “We’ve made it!”\\nBy the time we reached Céleste’s restaurant we were dripping with sweat. Céleste\\nwas at his usual place beside the entrance, with his apron bulging on his paunch, his\\nwhite mustache well to the fore. When he saw me he was sympathetic and “hoped I\\nwasn’t feeling too badly.” I said, “No,” but I was extremely hungry. I ate very\\nquickly and had some coffee to finish up. Then I went to my place and took a short\\nnap, as I’d drunk a glass of wine too many.\\nWhen I woke I smoked a cigarette before getting off my bed. I was a bit late and\\nhad to run for the streetcar. The office was stifling, and I was kept hard at it all the\\nafternoon. So it came as a relief when we closed down and I was strolling slowly\\nalong the wharves in the coolness. The sky was green, and it was pleasant to be outof-doors after the stuffy office. However, I went straight home, as I had to put some\\npotatoes on to boil.\\nThe hall was dark and, when I was starting up the stairs, I almost bumped into old\\nSalamano, who lived on the same floor as I. As usual, he had his dog with him. For\\neight years the two had been inseparable. Salamano’s spaniel is an ugly brute,\\n18\\n\\n\\n\\nafflicted with some skin disease—mange, I suspect; anyhow, it has lost all its hair\\nand its body is covered with brown scabs. Perhaps through living in one small room,\\ncooped up with his dog, Salamano has come to resemble it. His towy hair has gone\\nvery thin, and he has reddish blotches on his face. And the dog has developed\\nsomething of its master’s queer hunched-up gait; it always has its muzzle stretched\\nfar forward and its nose to the ground. But, oddly enough, though so much alike,\\nthey detest each other.\\nTwice a day, at eleven and six, the old fellow takes his dog for a walk, and for\\neight years that walk has never varied. You can see them in the rue de Lyon, the dog\\npulling his master along as hard as he can, till finally the old chap misses a step and\\nnearly falls. Then he beats his dog and calls it names. The dog cowers and lags\\nbehind, and it’s his master’s turn to drag him along. Presently the dog forgets, starts\\ntugging at the leash again, gets another hiding and more abuse. Then they halt on the\\npavement, the pair of them, and glare at each other; the dog with terror and the man\\nwith hatred in his eyes. Every time they’re out, this happens. When the dog wants to\\nstop at a lamppost, the old boy won’t let him, and drags him on, and the wretched\\nspaniel leaves behind him a trail of little drops. But, if he does it in the room, it\\nmeans another hiding.\\nIt’s been going on like this for eight years, and Céleste always says it’s a “crying\\nshame,” and something should be done about it; but really one can’t be sure. When I\\nmet him in the hall, Salamano was bawling at his dog, calling him a bastard, a lousy\\nmongrel, and so forth, and the dog was whining. I said, “Good evening,” but the old\\nfellow took no notice and went on cursing. So I thought I’d ask him what the dog had\\ndone. Again, he didn’t answer, but went on shouting, “You bloody cur!” and the rest\\nof it. I couldn’t see very clearly, but he seemed to be fixing something on the dog’s\\ncollar. I raised my voice a little. Without looking round, he mumbled in a sort of\\nsuppressed fury: “He’s always in the way, blast him!” Then he started up the stairs,\\nbut the dog tried to resist and flattened itself out on the floor, so he had to haul it up\\non the leash, step by step.\\nJust then another man who lives on my floor came in from the street. The general\\nidea hereabouts is that he’s a pimp. But if you ask him what his job is, he says he’s a\\nwarehouseman. One thing’s sure: he isn’t popular in our street. Still, he often has a\\nword for me, and drops in sometimes for a short talk in my room, because I listen to\\nhim. As a matter of fact, I find what he says quite interesting. So, really I’ve no\\nreason for freezing him off. His name is Sintès; Raymond Sintès. He’s short and\\nthick-set, has a nose like a boxer’s, and always dresses very sprucely. He, too, once\\nsaid to me, referring to Salamano, that it was “a damned shame,” and asked me if I\\nwasn’t disgusted by the way the old man served his dog. I answered: “No.”\\nWe went up the stairs together, Sintès and I, and when I was turning in at my door,\\nhe said:\\n19\\n\\n\\n\\n“Look here! How about having some grub with me? I’ve a black pudding and\\nsome wine.”\\nIt struck me that this would save my having to cook my dinner, so I said, “Thanks\\nvery much.”\\nHe, too, has only one room, and a little kitchen without a window. I saw a pinkand-white plaster angel above his bed, and some photos of sporting champions and\\nnaked girls pinned to the opposite wall. The bed hadn’t been made and the room was\\ndirty. He began by lighting a paraffin lamp; then fumbled in his pocket and produced\\na rather grimy bandage, which he wrapped round his right hand. I asked him what the\\ntrouble was. He told me he’d been having a roughhouse with a fellow who’d\\nannoyed him.\\n“I’m not one who looks for trouble,” he explained, “only I’m a bit short-tempered.\\nThat fellow said to me, challenging-like, ‘Come down off that streetcar, if you’re a\\nman.’ I says, ‘You keep quiet, I ain’t done nothing to you.’ Then he said I hadn’t any\\nguts. Well, that settled it. I got down off the streetcar and I said to him, ‘You better\\nkeep your mouth shut, or I’ll shut it for you.’ ‘I’d like to see you try!’ says he. Then I\\ngave him one across the face, and laid him out good and proper. After a bit I started\\nto help him get up, but all he did was to kick at me from where he lay. So I gave him\\none with my knee and a couple more swipes. He was bleeding like a pig when I’d\\ndone with him. I asked him if he’d had enough, and he said, ‘Yes.’ ”\\nSintès was busy fixing his bandage while he talked, and I was sitting on the bed.\\n“So you see,” he said, “it wasn’t my fault; he was asking for it, wasn’t he?”\\nI nodded, and he added:\\n“As a matter of fact, I rather want to ask your advice about something; it’s\\nconnected with this business. You’ve knocked about the world a bit, and I daresay\\nyou can help me. And then I’ll be your pal for life; I never forget anyone who does\\nme a good turn.”\\nWhen I made no comment, he asked me if I’d like us to be pals. I replied that I had\\nno objection, and that appeared to satisfy him. He got out the black pudding, cooked\\nit in a frying pan, then laid the table, putting out two bottles of wine. While he was\\ndoing this he didn’t speak.\\nWe started dinner, and then he began telling me the whole story, hesitating a bit at\\nfirst.\\n“There’s a girl behind it—as usual. We slept together pretty regular. I was keeping\\nher, as a matter of fact, and she cost me a tidy sum. That fellow I knocked down is\\nher brother.”\\nNoticing that I said nothing, he added that he knew what the neighbors said about\\nhim, but it was a filthy lie. He had his principles like everybody else, and a job in a\\nwarehouse.\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well,” he said, “to go on with my story ... I found out one day that she was letting\\nme down.” He gave her enough money to keep her going, without extravagance,\\nthough; he paid the rent of her room and twenty francs a day for food. “Three\\nhundred francs for rent, and six hundred for her grub, with a little present thrown in\\nnow and then, a pair of stockings or whatnot. Say, a thousand francs a month. But\\nthat wasn’t enough for my fine lady; she was always grumbling that she couldn’t\\nmake both ends meet with what I gave her. So one day I says to her, ‘Look here, why\\nnot get a job for a few hours a day? That’d make things easier for me, too. I bought\\nyou a new dress this month, I pay your rent and give you twenty francs a day. But\\nyou go and waste your money at the café with a pack of girls. You give them coffee\\nand sugar. And, of course, the money comes out of my pocket. I treat you on the\\nsquare, and that’s how you pay me back.’ But she wouldn’t hear of working, though\\nshe kept on saying she couldn’t make do with what I gave her. And then one day I\\nfound out she was doing me dirt.”\\nHe went on to explain that he’d found a lottery ticket in her bag, and, when he\\nasked where the money’d come from to buy it, she wouldn’t tell him. Then, another\\ntime, he’d found a pawn ticket for two bracelets that he’d never set eyes on.\\n“So I knew there was dirty work going on, and I told her I’d have nothing more to\\ndo with her. But, first, I gave her a good hiding, and I told her some home truths. I\\nsaid that there was only one thing interested her and that was getting into bed with\\nmen whenever she’d the chance. And I warned her straight, ‘You’ll be sorry one day,\\nmy girl, and wish you’d got me back. All the girls in the street, they’re jealous of\\nyour luck in having me to keep you.’ ”\\nHe’d beaten her till the blood came. Before that he’d never beaten her. “Well, not\\nhard, anyhow; only affectionately-like. She’d howl a bit, and I had to shut the\\nwindow. Then, of course, it ended as per usual. But this time I’m done with her.\\nOnly, to my mind, I ain’t punished her enough. See what I mean?”\\nHe explained that it was about this he wanted my advice. The lamp was smoking,\\nand he stopped pacing up and down the room, to lower the wick. I just listened,\\nwithout speaking. I’d had a whole bottle of wine to myself and my head was buzzing.\\nAs I’d used up my cigarettes I was smoking Raymond’s. Some late streetcars passed,\\nand the last noises of the street died off with them. Raymond went on talking. What\\nbored him was that he had “a sort of lech on her” as he called it. But he was quite\\ndetermined to teach her a lesson.\\nHis first idea, he said, had been to take her to a hotel, and then call in the special\\npolice. He’d persuade them to put her on the register as a “common prostitute,” and\\nthat would make her wild. Then he’d looked up some friends of his in the\\nunderworld, fellows who kept tarts for what they could make out of them, but they\\nhad practically nothing to suggest. Still, as he pointed out, that sort of thing should\\nhave been right up their street; what’s the good of being in that line if you don’t\\n21\\n\\n\\n\\nknow how to treat a girl who’s let you down? When he told them that, they suggested\\nhe should “brand” her. But that wasn’t what he wanted, either. It would need a lot of\\nthinking out. ... But, first, he’d like to ask me something. Before he asked it, though,\\nhe’d like to have my opinion of the story he’d been telling, in a general way.\\nI said I hadn’t any, but I’d found it interesting.\\nDid I think she really had done him dirt?\\nI had to admit it looked like that. Then he asked me if I didn’t think she should be\\npunished and what I’d do if I were in his shoes. I told him one could never be quite\\nsure how to act in such cases, but I quite understood his wanting her to suffer for it.\\nI drank some more wine, while Raymond lit another cigarette and began\\nexplaining what he proposed to do. He wanted to write her a letter, “a real stinker,\\nthat’ll get her on the raw,” and at the same time make her repent of what she’d done.\\nThen, when she came back, he’d go to bed with her and, just when she was “properly\\nprimed up,” he’d spit in her face and throw her out of the room. I agreed it wasn’t a\\nbad plan; it would punish her, all right.\\nBut, Raymond told me, he didn’t feel up to writing the kind of letter that was\\nneeded, and that was where I could help. When I didn’t say anything, he asked me if\\nI’d mind doing it right away, and I said, “No,” I’d have a shot at it.\\nHe drank off a glass of wine and stood up. Then he pushed aside the plates and the\\nbit of cold pudding that was left, to make room on the table. After carefully wiping\\nthe oilcloth, he got a sheet of squared paper from the drawer of his bedside table;\\nafter that, an envelope, a small red wooden penholder, and a square inkpot with\\npurple ink in it. The moment he mentioned the girl’s name I knew she was a Moor.\\nI wrote the letter. I didn’t take much trouble over it, but I wanted to satisfy\\nRaymond, as I’d no reason not to satisfy him. Then I read out what I’d written.\\nPuffing at his cigarette, he listened, nodding now and then. “Read it again, please,”\\nhe said. He seemed delighted. “That’s the stuff,” he chuckled. “I could tell you was a\\nbrainy sort, old boy, and you know what’s what.”\\nAt first I hardly noticed that “old boy.” It came back to me when he slapped me on\\nthe shoulder and said, “So now we’re pals, ain’t we?” I kept silence and he said it\\nagain. I didn’t care one way or the other, but as he seemed so set on it, I nodded and\\nsaid, “Yes.”\\nHe put the letter into the envelope and we finished off the wine. Then both of us\\nsmoked for some minutes, without speaking. The street was quite quiet, except when\\nnow and again a car passed. Finally, I remarked that it was getting late, and\\nRaymond agreed. “Time’s gone mighty fast this evening,” he added, and in a way\\nthat was true. I wanted to be in bed, only it was such an effort making a move. I must\\nhave looked tired, for Raymond said to me, “You mustn’t let things get you down.”\\nAt first I didn’t catch his meaning. Then he explained that he had heard of my\\n\\n22\\n\\n\\n\\nmother’s death; anyhow, he said, that was something bound to happen one day or\\nanother. I appreciated that, and told him so.\\nWhen I rose, Raymond shook hands very warmly, remarking that men always\\nunderstood each other. After closing the door behind me I lingered for some\\nmoments on the landing. The whole building was as quiet as the grave, a dank, dark\\nsmell rising from the well hole of the stairs. I could hear nothing but the blood\\nthrobbing in my ears, and for a while I stood still, listening to it. Then the dog began\\nto moan in old Salamano’s room, and through the sleep-bound house the little\\nplaintive sound rose slowly, like a flower growing out of the silence and the\\ndarkness.\\n\\n23\\n\\n\\n\\nIV\\nI HAD a busy time in the office throughout the week. Raymond dropped in once to\\ntell me he’d sent off the letter. I went to the pictures twice with Emmanuel, who\\ndoesn’t always understand what’s happening on the screen and asks me to explain it.\\nYesterday was Saturday, and Marie came as we’d arranged. She had a very pretty\\ndress, with red and white stripes, and leather sandals, and I couldn’t take my eyes off\\nher. One could see the outline of her firm little breasts, and her sun-tanned face was\\nlike a velvety brown flower. We took the bus and went to a beach I know, some\\nmiles out of Algiers. It’s just a strip of sand between two rocky spurs, with a line of\\nrushes at the back, along the tide line. At four o’clock the sun wasn’t too hot, but the\\nwater was pleasantly tepid, and small, languid ripples were creeping up the sand.\\nMarie taught me a new game. The idea was, while one swam, to suck in the spray\\noff the waves and, when one’s mouth was full of foam, to lie on one’s back and spout\\nit out against the sky. It made a sort of frothy haze that melted into the air or fell back\\nin a warm shower on one’s cheeks. But very soon my mouth was smarting with all\\nthe salt I’d drawn in; then Marie came up and hugged me in the water, and pressed\\nher mouth to mine. Her tongue cooled my lips, and we let the waves roll us about for\\na minute or two before swimming back to the beach.\\nWhen we had finished dressing, Marie looked hard at me. Her eyes were\\nsparkling. I kissed her; after that neither of us spoke for quite a while. I pressed her to\\nmy side as we scrambled up the foreshore. Both of us were in a hurry to catch the\\nbus, get back to my place, and tumble on to the bed. I’d left my window open, and it\\nwas pleasant to feel the cool night air flowing over our sunburned bodies.\\nMarie said she was free next morning, so I proposed she should have luncheon\\nwith me. She agreed, and I went down to buy some meat. On my way back I heard a\\nwoman’s voice in Raymond’s room. A little later old Salamano started grumbling at\\nhis dog and presently there was a sound of boots and paws on the wooden stairs;\\nthen, “Filthy brute! Get on, you cur!” and the two of them went out into the street. I\\ntold Marie about the old man’s habits, and it made her laugh. She was wearing one of\\nmy pajama suits, and had the sleeves rolled up. When she laughed I wanted her\\nagain. A moment later she asked me if I loved her. I said that sort of question had no\\nmeaning, really; but I supposed I didn’t. She looked sad for a bit, but when we were\\ngetting our lunch ready she brightened up and started laughing, and when she laughs\\nI always want to kiss her. It was just then that the row started in Raymond’s room.\\nFirst we heard a woman saying something in a high-pitched voice; then Raymond\\nbawling at her, “You let me down, you bitch! I’ll learn you to let me down!” There\\ncame some thuds, then a piercing scream—it made one’s blood run cold—and in a\\nmoment there was a crowd of people on the landing. Marie and I went out to see. The\\n24\\n\\n\\n\\nwoman was still screaming and Raymond still knocking her about. Marie said,\\nwasn’t it horrible! I didn’t answer anything. Then she asked me to go and fetch a\\npoliceman, but I told her I didn’t like policemen. However, one turned up presently;\\nthe lodger on the second floor, a plumber, came up, with him. When he banged on\\nthe door the noise stopped inside the room. He knocked again, and, after a moment,\\nthe woman started crying, and Raymond opened the door. He had a cigarette\\ndangling from his underlip and a rather sickly smile.\\n“Your name?” Raymond gave his name. “Take that cigarette out of your mouth\\nwhen you’re talking to me,” the policeman said gruffly. Raymond hesitated, glanced\\nat me, and kept the cigarette in his mouth. The policeman promptly swung his arm\\nand gave him a good hard smack on the left cheek. The cigarette shot from his lips\\nand dropped a yard away. Raymond made a wry face, but said nothing for a moment.\\nThen in a humble tone he asked if he mightn’t pick up his cigarette.\\nThe officer said, “Yes,” and added: “But don’t you forget next time that we don’t\\nstand for any nonsense, not from guys like you.”\\nMeanwhile the girl went on sobbing and repeating: “He hit me, the coward. He’s a\\npimp.”\\n“Excuse me, officer,” Raymond put in, “but is that in order, calling a man a pimp\\nin the presence of witnesses?”\\nThe policeman told him to shut his trap.\\nRaymond then turned to the girl. “Don’t you worry, my pet. We’ll meet again.”\\n“That’s enough,” the policeman said, and told the girl to go away. Raymond was\\nto stay in his room till summoned to the police station. “You ought to be ashamed of\\nyourself,” the policeman added, “getting so tight you can’t stand steady. Why, you’re\\nshaking all over!”\\n“I’m not tight,” Raymond explained. “Only when I see you standing there and\\nlooking at me, I can’t help trembling. That’s only natural.”\\nThen he closed his door, and we all went away. Marie and I finished getting our\\nlunch ready. But she hadn’t any appetite, and I ate nearly all. She left at one, and then\\nI had a nap.\\nToward three there was a knock at my door and Raymond came in. He sat down\\non the edge of my bed and for a minute or two said nothing. I asked him how it had\\ngone off. He said it had all gone quite smoothly at first, as per program; only then\\nshe’d slapped his face and he’d seen red, and started thrashing her. As for what\\nhappened after that, he needn’t tell me, as I was there.\\n“Well,” I said, “you taught her a lesson, all right, and that’s what you wanted, isn’t\\nit?”\\nHe agreed, and pointed out that whatever the police did, that wouldn’t change the\\nfact she’d had her punishment. As for the police, he knew exactly how to handle\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\n\\nthem. But he’d like to know if I’d expected him to return the blow when the\\npoliceman hit him.\\nI told him I hadn’t expected anything whatsoever and, anyhow, I had no use for\\nthe police. Raymond seemed pleased and asked if I’d like to come out for a stroll\\nwith him. I got up from the bed and started brushing my hair. Then Raymond said\\nthat what he really wanted was for me to act as his witness. I told him I had no\\nobjection; only I didn’t know what he expected me to say.\\n“It’s quite simple,” he replied. “You’ve only got to tell them that the girl had let\\nme down.”\\nSo I agreed to be his witness.\\nWe went out together, and Raymond stood me a brandy in a café. Then we had a\\ngame of billiards; it was a close game and I lost by only a few points. After that he\\nproposed going to a brothel, but I refused; I didn’t feel like it. As we were walking\\nslowly back he told me how pleased he was at having paid out his mistress so\\nsatisfactorily. He made himself extremely amiable to me, and I quite enjoyed our\\nwalk.\\nWhen we were nearly home I saw old Salamano on the doorstep; he seemed very\\nexcited. I noticed that his dog wasn’t with him. He was turning like a teetotum,\\nlooking in all directions, and sometimes peering into the darkness of the hall with his\\nlittle bloodshot eyes. Then he’d mutter something to himself and start gazing up and\\ndown the street again.\\nRaymond asked him what was wrong, but he didn’t answer at once. Then I heard\\nhim grunt, “The bastard! The filthy cur!” When I asked him where his dog was, he\\nscowled at me and snapped out, “Gone!” A moment later, all of a sudden, he\\nlaunched out into it.\\n“I’d taken him to the Parade Ground as usual. There was a fair on, and you could\\nhardly move for the crowd. I stopped at one of the booths to look at the Handcuff\\nKing. When I turned to go, the dog was gone. I’d been meaning to get a smaller\\ncollar, but I never thought the brute could slip it and get away like that.”\\nRaymond assured him the dog would find its way home, and told him stories of\\ndogs that had traveled miles and miles to get back to their masters. But this seemed\\nto make the old fellow even more worried than before.\\n“Don’t you understand, they’ll do away with him; the police, I mean. It’s not\\nlikely anyone will take him in and look after him; with all those scabs he puts\\neverybody off.”\\nI told him that there was a pound at the police station, where stray dogs are taken.\\nHis dog was certain to be there and he could get it back on payment of a small\\ncharge. He asked me how much the charge was, but there I couldn’t help him. Then\\nhe flew into a rage again.\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\n\\n“Is it likely I’d give money for a mutt like that? No damned fear! They can kill\\nhim, for all I care.” And he went on calling his dog the usual names.\\nRaymond gave a laugh and turned into the hall. I followed him upstairs, and we\\nparted on the landing. A minute or two later I heard Salamano’s footsteps and a\\nknock on my door.\\nWhen I opened it, he halted for a moment in the doorway.\\n“Excuse me ... I hope I’m not disturbing you.”\\nI asked him in, but he shook his head. He was staring at his toe caps, and the\\ngnarled old hands were trembling. Without meeting my eyes, he started talking.\\n“They won’t really take him from me, will they, Monsieur Meursault? Surely they\\nwouldn’t do a thing like that. If they do—I don’t know what will become of me.”\\nI told him that, so far as I knew, they kept stray dogs in the pound for three days,\\nwaiting for their owners to call for them. After that they disposed of the dogs as they\\nthought fit.\\nHe stared at me in silence for a moment, then said, “Good evening.” After that I\\nheard him pacing up and down his room for quite a while. Then his bed creaked.\\nThrough the wall there came to me a little wheezing sound, and I guessed that he was\\nweeping. For some reason, I don’t know what, I began thinking of Mother. But I had\\nto get up early next day; so, as I wasn’t feeling hungry, I did without supper, and\\nwent straight to bed.\\n\\n27\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\nRAYMOND rang me up at the office. He said that a friend of his—to whom he’d\\nspoken about me—invited me to spend next Sunday at his little seaside bungalow\\njust outside Algiers. I told him I’d have been delighted; only I had promised to spend\\nSunday with a girl. Raymond promptly replied that she could come, too. In fact, his\\nfriend’s wife would be very pleased not to be the only woman in a party of men.\\nI’d have liked to hang up at once, as my employer doesn’t approve of my using the\\noffice phone for private calls. But Raymond asked me to hold on; he had something\\nelse to tell me, and that was why he’d rung me up, though he could have waited till\\nthe evening to pass on the invitation.\\n“It’s like this,” he said. “I’ve been shadowed all the morning by some Arabs. One\\nof them’s the brother of that girl I had the row with. If you see him hanging round the\\nhouse when you come back, pass me the word.”\\nI promised to do so.\\nJust then my employer sent for me. For a moment I felt uneasy, as I expected he\\nwas going to tell me to stick to my work and not waste time chattering with friends\\nover the phone. However, it was nothing of the kind. He wanted to discuss a project\\nhe had in view, though so far he’d come to no decision. It was to open a branch at\\nParis, so as to be able to deal with the big companies on the spot, without postal\\ndelays, and he wanted to know if I’d like a post there.\\n“You’re a young man,” he said, “and I’m pretty sure you’d enjoy living in Paris.\\nAnd, of course, you could travel about France for some months in the year.”\\nI told him I was quite prepared to go; but really I didn’t care much one way or the\\nother.\\nHe then asked if a “change of life,” as he called it, didn’t appeal to me, and I\\nanswered that one never changed his way of life; one life was as good as another, and\\nmy present one suited me quite well.\\nAt this he looked rather hurt, and told me that I always shilly-shallied, and that I\\nlacked ambition—a grave defect, to his mind, when one was in business.\\nI returned to my work. I’d have preferred not to vex him, but I saw no reason for\\n“changing my life.” By and large it wasn’t an unpleasant one. As a student I’d had\\nplenty of ambition of the kind he meant. But, when I had to drop my studies, I very\\nsoon realized all that was pretty futile.\\nMarie came that evening and asked me if I’d marry her. I said I didn’t mind; if she\\nwas keen on it, we’d get married.\\nThen she asked me again if I loved her. I replied, much as before, that her question\\nmeant nothing or next to nothing—but I supposed I didn’t.\\n“If that’s how you feel,” she said, “why marry me?”\\n28\\n\\n\\n\\nI explained that it had no importance really, but, if it would give her pleasure, we\\ncould get married right away. I pointed out that, anyhow, the suggestion came from\\nher; as for me, I’d merely said, “Yes.”\\nThen she remarked that marriage was a serious matter.\\nTo which I answered: “No.”\\nShe kept silent after that, staring at me in a curious way. Then she asked:\\n“Suppose another girl had asked you to marry her—I mean, a girl you liked in the\\nsame way as you like me—would you have said ‘Yes’ to her, too?”\\n“Naturally.”\\nThen she said she wondered if she really loved me or not. I, of course, couldn’t\\nenlighten her as to that. And, after another silence, she murmured something about\\nmy being “a queer fellow.” “And I daresay that’s why I love you,” she added. “But\\nmaybe that’s why one day I’ll come to hate you.”\\nTo which I had nothing to say, so I said nothing.\\nShe thought for a bit, then started smiling and, taking my arm, repeated that she\\nwas in earnest; she really wanted to marry me.\\n“All right,” I answered. “We’ll get married whenever you like.” I then mentioned\\nthe proposal made by my employer, and Marie said she’d love to go to Paris.\\nWhen I told her I’d lived in Paris for a while, she asked me what it was like.\\n“A dingy sort of town, to my mind. Masses of pigeons and dark courtyards. And\\nthe people have washed-out, white faces.”\\nThen we went for a walk all the way across the town by the main streets. The\\nwomen were good-lookers, and I asked Marie if she, too, noticed this. She said,\\n“Yes,” and that she saw what I meant. After that we said nothing for some minutes.\\nHowever, as I didn’t want her to leave me, I suggested we should dine together at\\nCéleste’s. She’d have loved to dine with me, she said, only she was booked up for\\nthe evening. We were near my place, and I said, “Au revoir, then.”\\nShe looked me in the eyes.\\n“Don’t you want to know what I’m doing this evening?”\\nI did want to know, but I hadn’t thought of asking her, and I guessed she was\\nmaking a grievance of it. I must have looked embarrassed, for suddenly she started\\nlaughing and bent toward me, pouting her lips for a kiss.\\nI went by myself to Céleste’s. When I had just started my dinner an odd-looking\\nlittle woman came in and asked if she might sit at my table. Of course she might. She\\nhad a chubby face like a ripe apple, bright eyes, and moved in a curiously jerky way,\\nas if she were on wires. After taking off her closefitting jacket she sat down and\\nstarted studying the bill of fare with a sort of rapt attention. Then she called Céleste\\nand gave her order, very fast but quite distinctly; one didn’t lose a word. While\\nwaiting for the hors d’oeuvre she opened her bag, took out a slip of paper and a\\npencil, and added up the bill in advance. Diving into her bag again, she produced a\\n29\\n\\n\\n\\npurse and took from it the exact sum, plus a small tip, and placed it on the cloth in\\nfront of her.\\nJust then the waiter brought the hors d’oeuvre, which she proceeded to wolf down\\nvoraciously. While waiting for the next course, she produced another pencil, this\\ntime a blue one, from her bag, and the radio magazine for the coming week, and\\nstarted making ticks against almost all the items of the daily programs. There were a\\ndozen pages in the magazine, and she continued studying them closely throughout\\nthe meal. When I’d finished mine she was still ticking off items with the same\\nmeticulous attention. Then she rose, put on her jacket again with the same abrupt,\\nrobot-like gestures, and walked briskly out of the restaurant.\\nHaving nothing better to do, I followed her for a short distance. Keeping on the\\ncurb of the pavement, she walked straight ahead, never swerving or looking back,\\nand it was extraordinary how fast she covered the ground, considering her smallness.\\nIn fact, the pace was too much for me, and I soon lost sight of her and turned back\\nhomeward. For a moment the “little robot” (as I thought of her) had much impressed\\nme, but I soon forgot about her.\\nAs I was turning in at my door I ran into old Salamano. I asked him into my room,\\nand he informed me that his dog was definitely lost. He’d been to the pound to\\ninquire, but it wasn’t there, and the staff told him it had probably been run over.\\nWhen he asked them whether it was any use inquiring about it at the police station,\\nthey said the police had more important things to attend to than keeping records of\\nstray dogs run over in the streets. I suggested he should get another dog, but,\\nreasonably enough, he pointed out that he’d become used to this one, and it wouldn’t\\nbe the same thing.\\nI was seated on my bed, with my legs up, and Salamano on a chair beside the\\ntable, facing me, his hands spread on his knees. He had kept on his battered felt hat\\nand was mumbling away behind his draggled yellowish mustache. I found him rather\\nboring, but I had nothing to do and didn’t feel sleepy. So, to keep the conversation\\ngoing, I asked some questions about his dog—how long he had had it and so forth.\\nHe told me he had got it soon after his wife’s death. He’d married rather late in life.\\nWhen a young man, he wanted to go on the stage; during his military service he’d\\noften played in the regimental theatricals and acted rather well, so everybody said.\\nHowever, finally, he had taken a job in the railway, and he didn’t regret it, as now he\\nhad a small pension. He and his wife had never hit it off very well, but they’d got\\nused to each other, and when she died he felt lonely. One of his mates on the railway\\nwhose bitch had just had pups had offered him one, and he had taken it, as a\\ncompanion. He’d had to feed it from the bottle at first. But, as a dog’s life is shorter\\nthan a man’s, they’d grown old together, so to speak.\\n“He was a cantankerous brute,” Salamano said. “Now and then we had some\\nproper set-tos, he and I. But he was a good mutt all the same.”\\n30\\n\\n\\n\\nI said he looked well bred, and that evidently pleased the old man.\\n“Ah, but you should have seen him before his illness!” he said. “He had a\\nwonderful coat; in fact, that was his best point, really. I tried hard to cure him; every\\nmortal night after he got that skin disease I rubbed an ointment in. But his real\\ntrouble was old age, and there’s no curing that.”\\nJust then I yawned, and the old man said he’d better make a move. I told him he\\ncould stay, and that I was sorry about what had happened to his dog. He thanked me,\\nand mentioned that my mother had been very fond of his dog. He referred to her as\\n“your poor mother,” and was afraid I must be feeling her death terribly. When I said\\nnothing he added hastily and with a rather embarrassed air that some of the people in\\nthe street said nasty things about me because I’d sent my mother to the Home. But\\nhe, of course, knew better; he knew how devoted to my mother I had always been.\\nI answered—why, I still don’t know—that it surprised me to learn I’d produced\\nsuch a bad impression. As I couldn’t afford to keep her here, it seemed the obvious\\nthing to do, to send her to a home. “In any case,” I added, “for years she’d never had\\na word to say to me, and I could see she was moping, with no one to talk to.”\\n“Yes,” he said, “and at a home one makes friends, anyhow.”\\nHe got up, saying it was high time for him to be in bed, and added that life was\\ngoing to be a bit of a problem for him, under the new conditions. For the first time\\nsince I’d known him he held out his hand to me—rather shyly, I thought—and I\\ncould feel the scales on his skin. Just as he was going out of the door, he turned and,\\nsmiling a little, said:\\n“Let’s hope the dogs won’t bark again tonight. I always think it’s mine I hear. ...”\\n\\n31\\n\\n\\n\\nVI\\nIT was an effort waking up that Sunday morning; Marie had to jog my shoulders and\\nshout my name. As we wanted to get into the water early, we didn’t trouble about\\nbreakfast. My head was aching slightly and my first cigarette had a bitter taste. Marie\\ntold me I looked like a mourner at a funeral, and I certainly did feel very limp. She\\nwas wearing a white dress and had her hair loose. I told her she looked quite\\nravishing like that, and she laughed happily.\\nOn our way out we banged on Raymond’s door, and he shouted that he’d be with\\nus in a jiffy. We went down to the street and, because of my being rather under the\\nweather and our having kept the blind down in my room, the glare of the morning\\nsun hit me in the eyes like a clenched fist.\\nMarie, however, was almost dancing with delight, and kept repeating, “What a\\nheavenly day!” After a few minutes I was feeling better, and noticed that I was\\nhungry. I mentioned this to Marie, but she paid no attention. She was carrying an\\noilcloth bag in which she had stowed our bathing kit and a towel. Presently we heard\\nRaymond shutting his door. He was wearing blue trousers, a short-sleeved white\\nshirt, and a straw hat. I noticed that his forearms were rather hairy, but the skin was\\nvery white beneath. The straw hat made Marie giggle. Personally, I was rather put off\\nby his getup. He seemed in high spirits and was whistling as he came down the stairs.\\nHe greeted me with, “Hello, old boy!” and addressed Marie as “Mademoiselle.”\\nOn the previous evening we had visited the police station, where I gave evidence\\nfor Raymond—about the girl’s having been false to him. So they let him off with a\\nwarning. They didn’t check my statement.\\nAfter some talk on the doorstep we decided to take the bus. The beach was within\\neasy walking distance, but the sooner we got there the better. Just as we were starting\\nfor the bus stop, Raymond plucked my sleeve and told me to look across the street. I\\nsaw some Arabs lounging against the tobacconist’s window. They were staring at us\\nsilently, in the special way these people have—as if we were blocks of stone or dead\\ntrees. Raymond whispered that the second Arab from the left was “his man,” and I\\nthought he looked rather worried However, he assured me that all that was ancient\\nhistory. Marie, who hadn’t followed his remarks, asked, “What is it?”\\nI explained that those Arabs across the way had a grudge against Raymond. She\\ninsisted on our going at once. Then Raymond laughed, and squared his shoulders.\\nThe young lady was quite right, he said. There was no point in hanging about here.\\nHalfway to the bus stop he glanced back over his shoulder and said the Arabs\\nweren’t following. I, too, looked back. They were exactly as before, gazing in the\\nsame vague way at the spot where we had been.\\n\\n32\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen we were in the bus, Raymond, who now seemed quite at ease, kept making\\njokes to amuse Marie. I could see he was attracted by her, but she had hardly a word\\nfor him. Now and again she would catch my eye and smile.\\nWe alighted just outside Algiers. The beach is not far from the bus stop; one has\\nonly to cross a patch of highland, a sort of plateau, which overlooks the sea and\\nshelves down steeply to the sands. The ground here was covered with yellowish\\npebbles and wild lilies that showed snow-white against the blue of the sky, which\\nhad already the hard, metallic glint it gets on very hot days. Marie amused herself\\nswishing her bag against the flowers and sending the petals showering in all\\ndirections. Then we walked between two rows of little houses with wooden balconies\\nand green or white palings. Some of them were half hidden in clumps of tamarisks;\\nothers rose naked from the stony plateau. Before we came to the end of it, the sea\\nwas in full view; it lay smooth as a mirror, and in the distance a big headland jutted\\nout over its black reflection. Through the still air came the faint buzz of a motor\\nengine and we saw a fishing boat very far out, gliding almost imperceptibly across\\nthe dazzling smoothness.\\nMarie picked some rock irises. Going down the steep path leading to the sea, we\\nsaw some bathers already on the sands.\\nRaymond’s friend owned a small wooden bungalow at the near end of the beach.\\nIts back rested against the cliffside, while the front stood on piles, which the water\\nwas already lapping. Raymond introduced us to his friend, whose name was Masson.\\nHe was tall, broad-shouldered, and thick-set; his wife was a plump, cheerful little\\nwoman who spoke with a Paris accent.\\nMasson promptly told us to make ourselves at home. He had gone out fishing, he\\nsaid, first thing in the morning, and there would be fried fish for lunch. I\\ncongratulated him on his little bungalow, and he said he always spent his week ends\\nand holidays here. “With the missus, needless to say,” he added. I glanced at her, and\\nnoticed that she and Marie seemed to be getting on well together; laughing and\\nchattering away. For the first time, perhaps, I seriously considered the possibility of\\nmy marrying her.\\nMasson wanted to have a swim at once, but his wife and Raymond were\\ndisinclined to move. So only the three of us, Marie, Masson, and myself, went down\\nto the beach. Marie promptly plunged in, but Masson and I waited for a bit. He was\\nrather slow of speech and had, I noticed, a habit of saying “and what’s more”\\nbetween his phrases—even when the second added nothing really to the first. Talking\\nof Marie, he said: “She’s an awfully pretty girl, and what’s more, charming.”\\nBut I soon ceased paying attention to this trick of his; I was basking in the\\nsunlight, which, I noticed, was making me feel much better. The sand was beginning\\nto stoke up underfoot and, though I was eager for a dip, I postponed it for a minute or\\ntwo more. At last I said to Masson: “Shall we go in now?” and plunged. Masson\\n33\\n\\n\\n\\nwalked in gingerly and only began to swim when he was out of his depth. He swam\\nhand over hand and made slow headway, so I left him behind and caught up with\\nMarie. The water was cold and I felt all the better for it. We swam a long way out,\\nMarie and I, side by side, and it was pleasant feeling how our movements matched,\\nhers and mine, and how we were both in the same mood, enjoying every moment.\\nOnce we were out in the open, we lay on our backs and, as I gazed up at the sky, I\\ncould feel the sun drawing up the film of salt water on my lips and cheeks. We saw\\nMasson swim back to the beach and slump down on the sand under the sun. In the\\ndistance he looked enormous, like a stranded whale. Then Marie proposed that we\\nshould swim tandem. She went ahead and I put my arms round her waist, from\\nbehind, and while she drew me forward with her arm strokes, I kicked out behind to\\nhelp us on.\\nThat sound of little splashes had been in my ears for so long that I began to feel I’d\\nhad enough of it. So I let go of Marie and swam back at an easy pace, taking long,\\ndeep breaths. When I made the beach I stretched myself belly downward beside\\nMasson, resting my face on the sand. I told him “it was fine” here, and he agreed.\\nPresently Marie came back. I raised my head to watch her approach. She was\\nglistening with brine and holding her hair back. Then she lay down beside me, and\\nwhat with the combined warmth of our bodies and the sun, I felt myself dropping off\\nto sleep.\\nAfter a while Marie tugged my arm. and said Masson had gone to his place; it\\nmust be nearly lunchtime. I rose at once, as I was feeling hungry, but Marie told me I\\nhadn’t kissed her once since the early morning. That was so—though I’d wanted to,\\nseveral times. “Let’s go into the water again,” she said, and we ran into the sea and\\nlay flat amongst the ripples for a moment. Then we swam a few strokes, and when\\nwe were almost out of our depth she flung her arms round me and hugged me. I felt\\nher legs twining round mine, and my senses tingled.\\nWhen we got back, Masson was on the steps of his bungalow, shouting to us to\\ncome. I told him I was ravenously hungry, and he promptly turned to his wife and\\nsaid he’d taken quite a fancy to me. The bread was excellent, and I had my full share\\nof the fish. Then came some steak and potato chips. None of us spoke while eating.\\nMasson drank a lot of wine and kept refilling my glass the moment it was empty. By\\nthe time coffee was handed round I was feeling slightly muzzy, and I started smoking\\none cigarette after another. Masson, Raymond, and I discussed a plan of spending the\\nwhole of August on the beach together, sharing expenses.\\nSuddenly Marie exclaimed: “I say! Do you know the time? It’s only half-past\\neleven!”\\nWe were all surprised at that, and Masson remarked that we’d had a very early\\nlunch, but really lunch was a movable feast, you had it when you felt like it.\\nThis set Marie laughing, I don’t know why. I suspect she’d drunk a bit too much.\\n34\\n\\n\\n\\nThen Masson asked if I’d like to come with him for a stroll on the beach.\\n“My wife always has a nap after lunch,” he said. “Personally I find it doesn’t agree\\nwith me; what I need is a short walk. I’m always telling her it’s much better for the\\nhealth. But, of course, she’s entitled to her own opinion.”\\nMarie proposed to stay and help with the washing up. Mme Masson smiled and\\nsaid that, in that case, the first thing was to get the men out of the way. So we went\\nout together, the three of us.\\nThe light was almost vertical and the glare from the water seared one’s eyes. The\\nbeach was quite deserted now. One could hear a faint tinkle of knives and forks and\\ncrockery in the shacks and bungalows lining the foreshore. Heat was welling up from\\nthe rocks, and one could hardly breathe.\\nAt first Raymond and Masson talked of things and people I didn’t know. I\\ngathered that they’d been acquainted for some time and had even lived together for a\\nwhile. We went down to the water’s edge and walked along it; now and then a longer\\nwave wet our canvas shoes. I wasn’t thinking of anything, as all that sunlight beating\\ndown on my bare head made me feel half asleep.\\nJust then Raymond said something to Masson that I didn’t quite catch. But at the\\nsame moment I noticed two Arabs in blue dungarees a long way down the beach,\\ncoming in our direction. I gave Raymond a look and he nodded, saying, “That’s\\nhim.” We walked steadily on. Masson wondered how they’d managed to track us\\nhere. My impression was that they had seen us taking the bus and noticed Marie’s\\noilcloth bathing bag; but I didn’t say anything.\\nThough the Arabs walked quite slowly, they were much nearer already. We didn’t\\nchange our pace, but Raymond said:\\n“Listen! If there’s a roughhouse, you, Masson, take on the second one. I’ll tackle\\nthe fellow who’s after me. And you, Meursault, stand by to help if another one\\ncomes up, and lay him out.”\\nI said, “Right,” and Masson put his hands in his pockets.\\nThe sand was as hot as fire, and I could have sworn it was glowing red. The\\ndistance between us and the Arabs was steadily decreasing. When we were only a\\nfew steps away the Arabs halted. Masson and I slowed down, while Raymond went\\nstraight up to his man. I couldn’t hear what he said, but I saw the native lowering his\\nhead, as if to butt him in the chest. Raymond lashed out promptly and shouted to\\nMasson to come. Masson went up to the man he had been marking and struck him\\ntwice with all his might. The fellow fell flat into the water and stayed there some\\nseconds with bubbles coming up to the surface round his head. Meanwhile Raymond\\nhad been slogging the other man, whose face was streaming with blood. He glanced\\nat me over his shoulder and shouted:\\n“Just you watch! I ain’t finished with him yet!”\\n“Look out!” I cried. “He’s got a knife.”\\n35\\n\\n\\n\\nI spoke too late. The man had gashed Raymond’s arm and his mouth as well.\\nMasson sprang forward. The other Arab got up from the water and placed himself\\nbehind the fellow with the knife. We didn’t dare to move. The two natives backed\\naway slowly, keeping us at bay with the knife and never taking their eyes off us.\\nWhen they were at a safe distance they swung round and took to their heels. We\\nstood stock-still, with the sunlight beating down on us. Blood was dripping from\\nRaymond’s wounded arm, which he was squeezing hard above the elbow.\\nMasson remarked that there was a doctor who always spent his Sundays here, and\\nRaymond said: “Good. Let’s go to him at once.” He could hardly get the words out,\\nas the blood from his other wound made bubbles in his mouth.\\nWe each gave him an arm and helped him back to the bungalow. Once we were\\nthere he told us the wounds weren’t so very deep and he could walk to where the\\ndoctor was. Marie had gone quite pale, and Mme Masson was in tears.\\nMasson and Raymond went off to the doctor’s while I was left behind at the\\nbungalow to explain matters to the women. I didn’t much relish the task and soon\\ndried up and started smoking, staring at the sea.\\nRaymond came back at about half-past one, accompanied by Masson. He had his\\narm bandaged and a strip of sticking plaster on the corner of his mouth. The doctor\\nhad assured him it was nothing serious, but he was looking very glum. Masson tried\\nto make him laugh, but without success.\\nPresently Raymond said he was going for a stroll on the beach. I asked him where\\nhe proposed to go, and he mumbled something about “wanting to take the air.” We—\\nMasson and I—then said we’d go with him, but he flew into a rage and told us to\\nmind our own business. Masson said we mustn’t insist, seeing the state he was in.\\nHowever, when he went out, I followed him.\\nIt was like a furnace outside, with the sunlight splintering into flakes of fire on the\\nsand and sea. We walked for quite a while, and I had an idea that Raymond had a\\ndefinite idea where he was going; but probably I was mistaken about this.\\nAt the end of the beach we came to a small stream that had cut a channel in the\\nsand, after coming out from behind a biggish rock. There we found our two Arabs\\nagain, lying on the sand in their blue dungarees. They looked harmless enough, as if\\nthey didn’t bear any malice, and neither made any move when we approached. The\\nman who had slashed Raymond stared at him without speaking. The other man was\\nblowing down a little reed and extracting from it three notes of the scale, which he\\nplayed over and over again, while he watched us from the corner of an eye.\\nFor a while nobody moved; it was all sunlight and silence except for the tinkle of\\nthe stream and those three little lonely sounds. Then Raymond put his hand to his\\nrevolver pocket, but the Arabs still didn’t move. I noticed the man playing on the\\nreed had his big toes splayed out almost at right angles to his feet.\\nStill keeping his eyes on his man, Raymond said to me: “Shall I plug him one?”\\n36\\n\\n\\n\\nI thought quickly. If I told him not to, considering the mood he was in, he might\\nvery well fly into a temper and use his gun. So I said the first thing that came into my\\nhead.\\n“He hasn’t spoken to you yet. It would be a lowdown trick to shoot him like that,\\nin cold blood.”\\nAgain, for some moments one heard nothing but the tinkle of the stream and the\\nflute notes weaving through the hot, still air.\\n“Well,” Raymond said at last, “if that’s how you feel, I’d better say something\\ninsulting, and if he answers back I’ll loose off.”\\n“Right,” I said. “Only, if he doesn’t get out his knife you’ve no business to fire.”\\nRaymond was beginning to fidget. The Arab with the reed went on playing, and\\nboth of them watched all our movements.\\n“Listen,” I said to Raymond. “You take on the fellow on the right, and give me\\nyour revolver. If the other one starts making trouble or gets out his knife, I’ll shoot.”\\nThe sun glinted on Raymond’s revolver as he handed it to me. But nobody made a\\nmove yet; it was just as if everything had closed in on us so that we couldn’t stir. We\\ncould only watch each other, never lowering our eyes; the whole world seemed to\\nhave come to a standstill on this little strip of sand between the sunlight and the sea,\\nthe twofold silence of the reed and stream. And just then it crossed my mind that one\\nmight fire, or not fire—and it would come to absolutely the same thing.\\nThen, all of a sudden, the Arabs vanished; they’d slipped like lizards under cover\\nof the rock. So Raymond and I turned and walked back. He seemed happier, and\\nbegan talking about the bus to catch for our return.\\nWhen we reached the bungalow Raymond promptly went up the wooden steps,\\nbut I halted on the bottom one. The light seemed thudding in my head and I couldn’t\\nface the effort needed to go up the steps and make myself amiable to the women. But\\nthe heat was so great that it was just as bad staying where I was, under that flood of\\nblinding light falling from the sky. To stay, or to make a move—it came to much the\\nsame. After a moment I returned to the beach, and started walking.\\nThere was the same red glare as far as eye could reach, and small waves were\\nlapping the hot sand in little, flurried gasps. As I slowly walked toward the boulders\\nat the end of the beach I could feel my temples swelling under the impact of the light.\\nIt pressed itself on me, trying to check my progress. And each time I felt a hot blast\\nstrike my forehead, I gritted my teeth, I clenched my fists in my trouser pockets and\\nkeyed up every nerve to fend off the sun and the dark befuddlement it was pouring\\ninto me. Whenever a blade of vivid light shot upward from a bit of shell or broken\\nglass lying on the sand, my jaws set hard. I wasn’t going to be beaten, and I walked\\nsteadily on.\\nThe small black hump of rock came into view far down the beach. It was rimmed\\nby a dazzling sheen of light and feathery spray, but I was thinking of the cold, clear\\n37\\n\\n\\n\\nstream behind it, and longing to hear again the tinkle of running water. Anything to\\nbe rid of the glare, the sight of women in tears, the strain and effort—and to retrieve\\nthe pool of shadow by the rock and its cool silence!\\nBut when I came nearer I saw that Raymond’s Arab had returned. He was by\\nhimself this time, lying on his back, his hands behind his head, his face shaded by the\\nrock while the sun beat on the rest of his body. One could see his dungarees steaming\\nin the heat. I was rather taken aback; my impression had been that the incident was\\nclosed, and I hadn’t given a thought to it on my way here.\\nOn seeing me, the Arab raised himself a little, and his hand went to his pocket.\\nNaturally, I gripped Raymond’s revolver in the pocket of my coat. Then the Arab let\\nhimself sink back again, but without taking his hand from his pocket. I was some\\ndistance off, at least ten yards, and most of the time I saw him as a blurred dark form\\nwobbling in the heat haze. Sometimes, however, I had glimpses of his eyes glowing\\nbetween the half-closed lids. The sound of the waves was even lazier, feebler, than at\\nnoon. But the light hadn’t changed; it was pounding as fiercely as ever on the long\\nstretch of sand that ended at the rock. For two hours the sun seemed to have made no\\nprogress; becalmed in a sea of molten steel. Far out on the horizon a steamer was\\npassing; I could just make out from the corner of an eye the small black moving\\npatch, while I kept my gaze fixed on the Arab.\\nIt struck me that all I had to do was to turn, walk away, and think no more about it.\\nBut the whole beach, pulsing with heat, was pressing on my back. I took some steps\\ntoward the stream. The Arab didn’t move. After all, there was still some distance\\nbetween us. Perhaps because of the shadow on his face, he seemed to be grinning at\\nme.\\nI waited. The heat was beginning to scorch my cheeks; beads of sweat were\\ngathering in my eyebrows. It was just the same sort of heat as at my mother’s\\nfuneral, and I had the same disagreeable sensations—especially in my forehead,\\nwhere all the veins seemed to be bursting through the skin. I couldn’t stand it any\\nlonger, and took another step forward. I knew it was a fool thing to do; I wouldn’t get\\nout of the sun by moving on a yard or so. But I took that step, just one step, forward.\\nAnd then the Arab drew his knife and held it up toward me, athwart the sunlight.\\nA shaft of light shot upward from the steel, and I felt as if a long, thin blade\\ntransfixed my forehead. At the same moment all the sweat that had accumulated in\\nmy eyebrows splashed down on my eyelids, covering them with a warm film of\\nmoisture. Beneath a veil of brine and tears my eyes were blinded; I was conscious\\nonly of the cymbals of the sun clashing on my skull, and, less distinctly, of the keen\\nblade of light flashing up from the knife, scarring my eyelashes, and gouging into my\\neyeballs.\\nThen everything began to reel before my eyes, a fiery gust came from the sea,\\nwhile the sky cracked in two, from end to end, and a great sheet of flame poured\\n38\\n\\n\\n\\ndown through the rift. Every nerve in my body was a steel spring, and my grip closed\\non the revolver. The trigger gave, and the smooth underbelly of the butt jogged my\\npalm. And so, with that crisp, whipcrack sound, it all began. I shook off my sweat\\nand the clinging veil of light. I knew I’d shattered the balance of the day, the\\nspacious calm of this beach on which I had been happy. But I fired four shots more\\ninto the inert body, on which they left no visible trace. And each successive shot was\\nanother loud, fateful rap on the door of my undoing.\\n\\n39\\n\\n\\n\\nPart Two\\nI\\nI was questioned several times immediately after my arrest. But they were all formal\\nexaminations, as to my identity and so forth. At the first of these, which took place at\\nthe police station, nobody seemed to have much interest in the case. However, when\\nI was brought before the examining magistrate a week later, I noticed that he eyed\\nme with distinct curiosity. Like the others, he began by asking my name, address,\\nand occupation, the date and place of my birth. Then he inquired if I had chosen a\\nlawyer to defend me. I answered, “No,” I hadn’t thought about it, and asked him if it\\nwas really necessary for me to have one.\\n“Why do you ask that?” he said. I replied that I regarded my case as very simple.\\nHe smiled. “Well, it may seem so to you. But we’ve got to abide by the law, and, if\\nyou don’t engage a lawyer, the court will have to appoint one for you.”\\nIt struck me as an excellent arrangement that the authorities should see to details\\nof this kind, and I told him so. He nodded, and agreed that the Code was all that\\ncould be desired.\\nAt first I didn’t take him quite seriously. The room in which he interviewed me\\nwas much like an ordinary sitting room, with curtained windows, and a single lamp\\nstanding on the desk. Its light fell on the armchair in which he’d had me sit, while his\\nown face stayed in shadow.\\nI had read descriptions of such scenes in books, and at first it all seemed like a\\ngame. After our conversation, however, I had a good look at him. He was a tall man\\nwith clean-cut features, deep-set blue eyes, a big gray mustache, and abundant,\\nalmost snow-white hair, and he gave me the impression of being highly intelligent\\nand, on the whole, likable enough. There was only one thing that put one off: his\\nmouth had now and then a rather ugly twist; but it seemed to be only a sort of\\nnervous tic. When leaving, I very nearly held out my hand and said, “Good-by”; just\\nin time I remembered that I’d killed a man.\\nNext day a lawyer came to my cell; a small, plump, youngish man with sleek\\nblack hair. In spite of the heat—I was in my shirt sleeves—he was wearing a dark\\nsuit, stiff collar, and a rather showy tie, with broad black and white stripes. After\\ndepositing his brief case on my bed, he introduced himself, and added that he’d\\nperused the record of my case with the utmost care. His opinion was that it would\\nneed cautious handling, but there was every prospect of my getting off, provided I\\nfollowed his advice. I thanked him, and he said: “Good. Now let’s get down to it.”\\n\\n40\\n\\n\\n\\nSitting on the bed, he said that they’d been making investigations into my private\\nlife. They had learned that my mother died recently in a home. Inquiries had been\\nconducted at Marengo and the police informed that I’d shown “great callousness” at\\nmy mother’s funeral.\\n“You must understand,” the lawyer said, “that I don’t relish having to question\\nyou about such a matter. But it has much importance, and, unless I find some way of\\nanswering the charge of ‘callousness,’ I shall be handicapped in conducting your\\ndefense. And that is where you, and only you, can help me.”\\nHe went on to ask if I had felt grief on that “sad occasion.” The question struck me\\nas an odd one; I’d have been much embarrassed if I’d had to ask anyone a thing like\\nthat.\\nI answered that, of recent years, I’d rather lost the habit of noting my feelings, and\\nhardly knew what to answer. I could truthfully say I’d been quite fond of Mother—\\nbut really that didn’t mean much. All normal people, I added as on afterthought, had\\nmore or less desired the death of those they loved, at some time or another.\\nHere the lawyer interrupted me, looking greatly perturbed.\\n“You must promise me not to say anything of that sort at the trial, or to the\\nexamining magistrate.”\\nI promised, to satisfy him, but I explained that my physical condition at any given\\nmoment often influenced my feelings. For instance, on the day I attended Mother’s\\nfuneral, I was fagged out and only half awake. So, really, I hardly took stock of what\\nwas happening. Anyhow, I could assure him of one thing: that I’d rather Mother\\nhadn’t died.\\nThe lawyer, however, looked displeased. “That’s not enough,” he said curtly.\\nAfter considering for a bit he asked me if he could say that on that day I had kept\\nmy feelings under control.\\n“No,” I said. “That wouldn’t be true.”\\nHe gave me a queer look, as if I slightly revolted him; then informed me, in an\\nalmost hostile tone, that in any case the head of the Home and some of the staff\\nwould be cited as witnesses.\\n“And that might do you a very nasty turn,” he concluded.\\nWhen I suggested that Mother’s death had no connection with the charge against\\nme, he merely replied that this remark showed I’d never had any dealings with the\\nlaw.\\nSoon after this he left, looking quite vexed. I wished he had stayed longer and I\\ncould have explained that I desired his sympathy, not for him to make a better job of\\nmy defense, but, if I might put it so, spontaneously. I could see that I got on his\\nnerves; he couldn’t make me out, and, naturally enough, this irritated him. Once or\\ntwice I had a mind to assure him that I was just like everybody else; quite an ordinary\\n\\n41\\n\\n\\n\\nperson. But really that would have served no great purpose, and I let it go—out of\\nlaziness as much as anything else.\\nLater in the day I was taken again to the examining magistrate’s office. It was two\\nin the afternoon and, this time, the room was flooded with light—there was only a\\nthin curtain on the window—and extremely hot.\\nAfter inviting me to sit down, the magistrate informed me in a very polite tone\\nthat, “owing to unforeseen circumstances,” my lawyer was unable to be present. I\\nshould be quite entitled, he added, to reserve my answers to his questions until my\\nlawyer could attend.\\nTo this I replied that I could answer for myself. He pressed a bell push on his desk\\nand a young clerk came in and seated himself just behind me. Then we—I and the\\nmagistrate—settled back in our chairs and the examination began. He led off by\\nremarking that I had the reputation of being a taciturn, rather self-centered person,\\nand he’d like to know what I had to say to that. I answered:\\n“Well, I rarely have anything much to say. So, naturally I keep my mouth shut.”\\nHe smiled as on the previous occasion, and agreed that that was the best of\\nreasons. “In any case,” he added, “it has little or no importance.”\\nAfter a short silence he suddenly leaned forward, looked me in the eyes, and said,\\nraising his voice a little:\\n“What really interests me is—you!”\\nI wasn’t quite clear what he meant, so I made no comment.\\n“There are several things,” he continued, “that puzzle me about your crime. I feel\\nsure that you will help me to understand them.”\\nWhen I replied that really it was quite simple, he asked me to give him an account\\nof what I’d done that day. As a matter of fact, I had already told him at our first\\ninterview—in a summary sort of way, of course—about Raymond, the beach, our\\nswim, the fight, then the beach again, and the five shots I’d fired. But I went over it\\nall again, and after each phrase he nodded. “Quite so, quite so.” When I described the\\nbody lying on the sand, he nodded more emphatically, and said, “Good!” I was tired\\nof repeating the same story; I felt as if I’d never talked so much in all my life before.\\nAfter another silence he stood up and said he’d like to help me; I interested him,\\nand, with God’s help, he would do something for me in my trouble. But, first, he\\nmust put a few more questions.\\nHe began by asking bluntly if I’d loved my mother.\\n“Yes,” I replied, “like everybody else.” The clerk behind me, who had been typing\\naway at a steady pace, must just then have hit the wrong keys, as I heard him pushing\\nthe carrier back and crossing something out.\\nNext, without any apparent logical connection, the magistrate sprang another\\nquestion.\\n“Why did you fire five consecutive shots?”\\n42\\n\\n\\n\\nI thought for a bit; then explained that they weren’t quite consecutive. I fired one\\nat first, and the other four after a short interval.\\n“Why did you pause between the first and second shot?”\\nI seemed to see it hovering again before my eyes, the red glow of the beach, and to\\nfeel that fiery breath on my cheeks—and, this time, I made no answer.\\nDuring the silence that followed, the magistrate kept fidgeting, running his fingers\\nthrough his hair, half rising, then sitting down again. Finally, planting his elbows on\\nthe desk, he bent toward me with a queer expression.\\n“But why, why did you go on firing at a prostrate man?”\\nAgain I found nothing to reply.\\nThe magistrate drew his hand across his forehead and repeated in a slightly\\ndifferent tone:\\n“I ask you ‘Why?’ I insist on your telling me.” I still kept silent.\\nSuddenly he rose, walked to a file cabinet standing against the opposite wall,\\npulled a drawer open, and took from it a silver crucifix, which he was waving as he\\ncame back to the desk.\\n“Do you know who this is?” His voice had changed completely; it was vibrant\\nwith emotion.\\n“Of course I do,” I answered.\\nThat seemed to start him off; he began speaking at a great pace. He told me he\\nbelieved in God, and that even the worst of sinners could obtain forgiveness of Him.\\nBut first he must repent, and become like a little child, with a simple, trustful heart,\\nopen to conviction. He was leaning right across the table, brandishing his crucifix\\nbefore my eyes.\\nAs a matter of fact, I had great difficulty in following his remarks, as, for one\\nthing, the office was so stiflingly hot and big flies were buzzing round and settling on\\nmy cheeks; also because he rather alarmed me. Of course, I realized it was absurd to\\nfeel like this, considering that, after all, it was I who was the criminal. However, as\\nhe continued talking, I did my best to understand, and I gathered that there was only\\none point in my confession that badly needed clearing up—the fact that I’d waited\\nbefore firing a second time. All the rest was, so to speak, quite in order; but that\\ncompletely baffled him.\\nI started to tell him that he was wrong in insisting on this; the point was of quite\\nminor importance. But, before I could get the words out, he had drawn himself up to\\nhis full height and was asking me very earnestly if I believed in God. When I said,\\n“No,” he plumped down into his chair indignantly.\\nThat was unthinkable, he said; all men believe in God, even those who reject Him.\\nOf this he was absolutely sure; if ever he came to doubt it, his life would lose all\\nmeaning. “Do you wish,” he asked indignantly, “my life to have no meaning?”\\nReally I couldn’t see how my wishes came into it, and I told him as much.\\n43\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile I was talking, he thrust the crucifix again just under my nose and shouted:\\n“I, anyhow, am a Christian. And I pray Him to forgive you for your sins. My poor\\nyoung man, how can you not believe that He suffered for your sake?”\\nI noticed that his manner seemed genuinely solicitous when he said, “My poor\\nyoung man”—but I was beginning to have enough of it. The room was growing\\nsteadily hotter.\\nAs I usually do when I want to get rid of someone whose conversation bores me, I\\npretended to agree. At which, rather to my surprise, his face lit up.\\n“You see! You see! Now won’t you own that you believe and put your trust in\\nHim?”\\nI must have shaken my head again, for he sank back in his chair, looking limp and\\ndejected.\\nFor some moments there was a silence during which the typewriter, which had\\nbeen clicking away all the time we talked, caught up with the last remark. Then he\\nlooked at me intently and rather sadly.\\n“Never in all my experience have I known a soul so case-hardened as yours,” he\\nsaid in a low tone. “All the criminals who have come before me until now wept when\\nthey saw this symbol of our Lord’s sufferings.”\\nI was on the point of replying that was precisely because they were criminals. But\\nthen I realized that I, too, came under that description. Somehow it was an idea to\\nwhich I never could get reconciled.\\nTo indicate, presumably, that the interview was over, the magistrate stood up. In\\nthe same weary tone he asked me a last question: Did I regret what I had done?\\nAfter thinking a bit, I said that what I felt was less regret than a kind of vexation—\\nI couldn’t find a better word for it. But he didn’t seem to understand. ... This was as\\nfar as things went at that day’s interview.\\nI came before the magistrate many times more, but on these occasions my lawyer\\nalways accompanied me. The examinations were confined to asking me to amplify\\nmy previous statements. Or else the magistrate and my lawyer discussed\\ntechnicalities. At such times they took very little notice of me, and, in any case, the\\ntone of the examinations changed as time went on. The magistrate seemed to have\\nlost interest in me, and to have come to some sort-of decision about my case. He\\nnever mentioned God again or displayed any of the religious fervor I had found so\\nembarrassing at our first interview. The result was that our relations became more\\ncordial. After a few questions, followed by an exchange of remarks with the lawyer,\\nthe magistrate closed the interview. My case was “taking its course,” as he put it.\\nSometimes, too, the conversation was of a general order, and the magistrate and\\nlawyer encouraged me to join in it. I began to breathe more freely. Neither of the two\\nmen, at these times, showed the least hostility toward me, and everything went so\\nsmoothly, so amiably, that I had an absurd impression of being “one of the family.” I\\n44\\n\\n\\n\\ncan honestly say that during the eleven months these examinations lasted I got so\\nused to them that I was almost surprised at having ever enjoyed anything better than\\nthose rare moments when the magistrate, after escorting me to the door of the office,\\nwould pat my shoulder and say in a friendly tone: “Well, Mr. Antichrist, that’s all for\\nthe present!” After which I was made over to my jailers.\\n\\n45\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\nTHERE are some things of which I’ve never cared to talk. And, a few days after I’d\\nbeen sent to prison, I decided that this phase of my life was one of them. However, as\\ntime went by, I came to feel that this aversion had no real substance. In point of fact,\\nduring those early days, I was hardly conscious of being in prison; I had always a\\nvague hope that something would turn up, some agreeable surprise.\\nThe change came soon after Marie’s first and only visit. From the day when I got\\nher letter telling me they wouldn’t let her come to see me any more, because she\\nwasn’t my wife—it was from that day that I realized that this cell was my last home,\\na dead end, so to speak.\\nOn the day of my arrest they put me in a biggish room with several other\\nprisoners, mostly Arabs. They grinned when they saw me enter, and asked me what\\nI’d done. I told them I’d killed an Arab, and they kept mum for a while. But\\npresently night began to fall, and one of them explained to me how to lay out my\\nsleeping mat. By rolling up one end one makes a sort of bolster. All night I felt bugs\\ncrawling over my face.\\nSome days later I was put by myself in a cell, where I slept on a plank bed hinged\\nto the wall. The only other furniture was a latrine bucket and a tin basin. The prison\\nstands on rising ground, and through my little window I had glimpses of the sea. One\\nday when I was hanging on the bars, straining my eyes toward the sunlight playing\\non the waves, a jailer entered and said I had a visitor. I thought it must be Marie, and\\nso it was.\\nTo go to the Visitors’ Room, I was taken along a corridor, then up a flight of steps,\\nthen along another corridor. It was a very large room, lit by a big bow window, and\\ndivided into three compartments by high iron grilles running transversally. Between\\nthe two grilles there was a gap of some thirty feet, a sort of no man’s land between\\nthe prisoners and their friends. I was led to a point exactly opposite Marie, who was\\nwearing her striped dress. On my side of the rails were about a dozen other prisoners,\\nArabs for the most part. On Marie’s side were mostly Moorish women. She was\\nwedged between a small old woman with tight-set lips and a fat matron, without a\\nhat, who was talking shrilly and gesticulated all the time. Because of the distance\\nbetween the visitors and prisoners I found I, too, had to raise my voice.\\nWhen I came into the room the babel of voices echoing on the bare walls, and the\\nsunlight streaming in, flooding everything in a harsh white glare, made me feel quite\\ndizzy. After the relative darkness and the silence of my cell it took me some\\nmoments to get used to these conditions. After a bit, however, I came to see each\\nface quite clearly, lit up as if a spotlight played on it.\\n\\n46\\n\\n\\n\\nI noticed a prison official seated at each end of the no man’s land between the\\ngrilles. The native prisoners and their relations on the other side were squatting\\nopposite each other. They didn’t raise their voices and, in spite of the din, managed\\nto converse almost in whispers. This murmur of voices coming from below made a\\nsort of accompaniment to the conversations going on above their heads. I took stock\\nof all this very quickly and moved a step forward toward Marie. She was pressing\\nher brown, sun-tanned face to the bars and smiling as hard as she could. I thought she\\nwas looking very pretty, but somehow couldn’t bring myself to tell her so.\\n“Well?” she asked, pitching her voice very high. “What about it? Are you all right,\\nhave you everything you want?”\\n“Oh, yes. I’ve everything I want.”\\nWe were silent for some moments; Marie went on smiling. The fat woman was\\nbawling at the prisoner beside me, her husband presumably, a tall, fair, pleasantlooking man.\\n“Jeanne refused to have him,” she yelled.\\n“That’s just too bad,” the man replied.\\n“Yes, and I told her you’d take him back the moment you got out; but she\\nwouldn’t hear of it.”\\nMarie shouted across the gap that Raymond sent me his best wishes, and I said,\\n“Thanks.” But my voice was drowned by my neighbor’s, asking “if he was quite fit.”\\nThe fat woman gave a laugh. “Fit? I should say he is! The picture of health.”\\nMeanwhile the prisoner on my left, a youngster with thin, girlish hands, never said\\na word. His eyes, I noticed, were fixed on the little old woman opposite him, and she\\nreturned his gaze with a sort of hungry passion. But I had to stop looking at them as\\nMarie was shouting to me that we mustn’t lose hope.\\n“Certainly not,” I answered. My gaze fell on her shoulders, and I had a sudden\\nlonging to squeeze them, through the thin dress. Its silky texture fascinated me, and I\\nhad a feeling that the hope she spoke of centered on it, somehow. I imagine\\nsomething of the same sort was in Marie’s mind, for she went on smiling, looking\\nstraight at me.\\n“It’ll all come right, you’ll see, and then we shall get married.”\\nAll I could see of her now was the white flash of her teeth, and the little puckers\\nround her eyes. I answered: “Do you really think so?” but chiefly because I felt it up\\nto me to answer something.\\nShe started talking very fast in the same high-pitched voice.\\n“Yes, you’ll be acquitted, and we’ll go bathing again, Sundays.”\\nThe woman beside me was still yelling away, telling her husband that she’d left a\\nbasket for him in the prison office. She gave a list of the things she’d brought and\\ntold him to mind and check them carefully, as some had cost quite a lot. The\\nyoungster on my other side and his mother were still gazing mournfully at each\\n47\\n\\n\\n\\nother, and the murmur of the Arabs droned on below us. The light outside seemed to\\nbe surging up against the window, seeping through, and smearing the faces of the\\npeople facing it with a coat of yellow oil.\\nI began to feel slightly squeamish, and wished I could leave. The strident voice\\nbeside me was jarring on my ears. But, on the other hand, I wanted to have the most I\\ncould of Marie’s company. I’ve no idea how much time passed. I remember Marie’s\\ndescribing to me her work, with that set smile always on her face. There wasn’t a\\nmoment’s letup in the noise—shouts, conversations, and always that muttering\\nundertone. The only oasis of silence was made by the young fellow and the old\\nwoman gazing into each other’s eyes.\\nThen, one by one, the Arabs were led away; almost everyone fell silent when the\\nfirst one left. The little old woman pressed herself against the bars and at the same\\nmoment a jailer tapped her son’s shoulder. He called, “Au revoir, Mother,” and,\\nslipping her hand between the bars, she gave him a small, slow wave with it.\\nNo sooner was she gone than a man, hat in hand, took her place. A prisoner was\\nled up to the empty place beside me, and the two started a brisk exchange of\\nremarks—not loud, however, as the room had become relatively quiet. Someone\\ncame and called away the man on my right, and his wife shouted at him—she didn’t\\nseem to realize it was no longer necessary to shout—“Now, mind you look after\\nyourself, dear, and don’t do anything rash!”\\nMy turn came next. Marie threw me a kiss. I looked back as I walked away. She\\nhadn’t moved; her face was still pressed to the rails, her lips still parted in that tense,\\ntwisted smile.\\nSoon after this I had a letter from her. And it was then that the things I’ve never\\nliked to talk about began. Not that they were particularly terrible; I’ve no wish to\\nexaggerate and I suffered less than others. Still, there was one thing in those early\\ndays that was really irksome: my habit of thinking like a free man. For instance, I\\nwould suddenly be seized with a desire to go down to the beach for a swim. And\\nmerely to have imagined the sound of ripples at my feet, the smooth feel of the water\\non my body as I struck out, and the wonderful sensation of relief it gave brought\\nhome still more cruelly the narrowness of my cell.\\nStill, that phase lasted a few months only. Afterward, I had prisoner’s thoughts. I\\nwaited for the daily walk in the courtyard or a visit from my lawyer. As for the rest\\nof the time, I managed quite well, really. I’ve often thought that had I been\\ncompelled to live in the trunk of a dead tree, with nothing to do but gaze up at the\\npatch of sky just overhead, I’d have got used to it by degrees. I’d have learned to\\nwatch for the passing of birds or drifting clouds, as I had come to watch for my\\nlawyer’s odd neckties, or, in another world, to wait patiently till Sunday for a spell of\\nlove-making with Marie. Well, here, anyhow, I wasn’t penned in a hollow tree trunk.\\nThere were others in the world worse off than I. I remembered it had been one of\\n48\\n\\n\\n\\nMother’s pet ideas—she was always voicing it—that in the long run one gets used to\\nanything.\\nUsually, however, I didn’t think things out so far. Those first months were trying,\\nof course; but the very effort I had to make helped me through them. For instance, I\\nwas plagued by the desire for a woman—which was natural enough, considering my\\nage. I never thought of Marie especially. I was obsessed by thoughts of this woman\\nor that, of all the ones I’d had, all the circumstances under which I’d loved them; so\\nmuch so that the cell grew crowded with their faces, ghosts of my old passions. That\\nunsettled me, no doubt; but, at least, it served to kill time.\\nI gradually became quite friendly with the chief jailer, who went the rounds with\\nthe kitchen hands at mealtimes. It was he who brought up the subject of women.\\n“That’s what the men here grumble about most,” he told me.\\nI said I felt like that myself. “There’s something unfair about it,” I added, “like\\nhitting a man when he’s down.”\\n“But that’s the whole point of it,” he said; “that’s why you fellows are kept in\\nprison.”\\n“I don’t follow.”\\n“Liberty,” he said, “means that. You’re being deprived of your liberty.”\\nIt had never before struck me in that light, but I saw his point. “That’s true,” I said.\\n“Otherwise it wouldn’t be a punishment.”\\nThe jailer nodded. “Yes, you’re different, you can use your brains. The others\\ncan’t. Still, those fellows find a way out; they do it by themselves.” With which\\nremark the jailer left my cell. Next day I did like the others.\\nThe lack of cigarettes, too, was a trial. When I was brought to the prison, they took\\naway my belt, my shoelaces, and the contents of my pockets, including my\\ncigarettes. Once I had been given a cell to myself I asked to be given back, anyhow,\\nthe cigarettes. Smoking was forbidden, they informed me. That, perhaps, was what\\ngot me down the most; in fact, I suffered really badly during the first few days. I\\neven tore off splinters from my plank bed and sucked them. All day long I felt faint\\nand bilious. It passed my understanding why I shouldn’t be allowed even to smoke; it\\ncould have done no one any harm. Later on, I understood the idea behind it; this\\nprivation, too, was part of my punishment. But, by the time I understood, I’d lost the\\ncraving, so it had ceased to be a punishment.\\nExcept for these privations I wasn’t too unhappy. Yet again, the whole problem\\nwas: how to kill time. After a while, however, once I’d learned the trick of\\nremembering things, I never had a moment’s boredom. Sometimes I would exercise\\nmy memory on my bedroom and, starting from a corner, make the round, noting\\nevery object I saw on the way. At first it was over in a minute or two. But each time I\\nrepeated the experience, it took a little longer. I made a point of visualizing every\\npiece of furniture, and each article upon or in it, and then every detail of each article,\\n49\\n\\n\\n\\nand finally the details of the details, so to speak: a tiny dent or incrustation, or a\\nchipped edge, and the exact grain and color of the woodwork. At the same time I\\nforced myself to keep my inventory in mind from start to finish, in the right order\\nand omitting no item. With the result that, after a few weeks, I could spend hours\\nmerely in listing the objects in my bedroom. I found that the more I thought, the\\nmore details, half-forgotten or malobserved, floated up from my memory. There\\nseemed no end to them.\\nSo I learned that even after a single day’s experience of the outside world a man\\ncould easily live a hundred years in prison. He’d have laid up enough memories\\nnever to be bored. Obviously, in one way, this was a compensation.\\nThen there was sleep. To begin with, I slept badly at night and never in the day.\\nBut gradually my nights became better, and I managed to doze off in the daytime as\\nwell. In fact, during the last months, I must have slept sixteen or eighteen hours out\\nof the twenty-four. So there remained only six hours to fill—with meals, relieving\\nnature, my memories ... and the story of the Czech.\\nOne day, when inspecting my straw mattress, I found a bit of newspaper stuck to\\nits underside. The paper was yellow with age, almost transparent, but I could still\\nmake out the letter print. It was the story of a crime. The first part was missing, but I\\ngathered that its scene was some village in Czechoslovakia. One of the villagers had\\nleft his home to try his luck abroad. After twenty-five years, having made a fortune,\\nhe returned to his country with his wife and child. Meanwhile his mother and sister\\nhad been running a small hotel in the village where he was born. He decided to give\\nthem a surprise and, leaving his wife and child in another inn, he went to stay at his\\nmother’s place, booking a room under an assumed name. His mother and sister\\ncompletely failed to recognize him. At dinner that evening he showed them a large\\nsum of money he had on him, and in the course of the night they slaughtered him\\nwith a hammer. After taking the money they flung the body into the river. Next\\nmorning his wife came and, without thinking, betrayed the guest’s identity. His\\nmother hanged herself. His sister threw herself into a well. I must have read that\\nstory thousands of times. In one way it sounded most unlikely; in another, it was\\nplausible enough. Anyhow, to my mind, the man was asking for trouble; one\\nshouldn’t play fool tricks of that sort.\\nSo, what with long bouts of sleep, my memories, readings of that scrap of\\nnewspaper, the tides of light and darkness, the days slipped by. I’d read, of course,\\nthat in jail one ends up by losing track of time. But this had never meant anything\\ndefinite to me. I hadn’t grasped how days could be at once long and short. Long, no\\ndoubt, as periods to live through, but so distended that they ended up by overlapping\\non each other. In fact, I never thought of days as such; only the words “yesterday”\\nand “tomorrow” still kept some meaning.\\n\\n50\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen, one morning, the jailer informed me I’d now been six months in jail, I\\nbelieved him—but the words conveyed nothing to my mind. To me it seemed like\\none and the same day that had been going on since I’d been in my cell, and that I’d\\nbeen doing the same thing all the time.\\nAfter the jailer left me I shined up my tin pannikin and studied my face in it. My\\nexpression was terribly serious, I thought, even when I tried to smile. I held the\\npannikin at different angles, but always my face had the same mournful, tense\\nexpression.\\nThe sun was setting and it was the hour of which I’d rather not speak—“the\\nnameless hour,” I called it—when evening sounds were creeping up from all the\\nfloors of the prison in a sort of stealthy procession. I went to the barred window and\\nin the last rays looked once again at my reflected face. It was as serious as before;\\nand that wasn’t surprising, as just then I was feeling serious. But, at the same time, I\\nheard something that I hadn’t heard for months. It was the sound of a voice; my own\\nvoice, there was no mistaking it. And I recognized it as the voice that for many a day\\nof late had been sounding in my ears. So I knew that all this time I’d been talking to\\nmyself.\\nAnd something I’d been told came back; a remark made by the nurse at Mother’s\\nfuneral. No, there was no way out, and no one can imagine what the evenings are like\\nin prison.\\n\\n51\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\nON THE whole I can’t say that those months passed slowly; another summer was on\\nits way almost before I realized the first was over. And I knew that with the first\\nreally hot days something new was in store for me. My case was down for the last\\nsessions of the Assize Court, and those sessions were due to end some time in June.\\nThe day on which my trial started was one of brilliant sunshine. My lawyer\\nassured me the case would take only two or three days. “From what I hear,” he\\nadded, “the court will dispatch your case as quickly as possible, as it isn’t the most\\nimportant one on the Cause List. There’s a case of parricide immediately after, which\\nwill take them some time.”\\nThey came for me at half-past seven in the morning and I was conveyed to the law\\ncourts in a prison van. The two policemen led me into a small room that smelled of\\ndarkness. We sat near a door through which came sounds of voices, shouts, chairs\\nscraping on the floor; a vague hubbub which reminded me of one of those smalltown “socials” when, after the concert’s over, the hall is cleared for dancing.\\nOne of my policemen told me the judges hadn’t arrived yet, and offered me a\\ncigarette, which I declined. After a bit he asked me if I was feeling nervous. I said,\\n“No,” and that the prospect of witnessing a trial rather interested me; I’d never had\\noccasion to attend one before.\\n“Maybe,” the other policeman said. “But after an hour or two one’s had enough of\\nit.”\\nAfter a while a small electric bell purred in the room. They unfastened my\\nhandcuffs, opened the door, and led me to the prisoner’s dock.\\nThere was a great crowd in the courtroom. Though the Venetian blinds were\\ndown, light was filtering through the chinks, and the air stiflingly hot already. The\\nwindows had been kept shut. I sat down, and the police officers took their stand on\\neach side of my chair.\\nIt was then that I noticed a row of faces opposite me. These people were staring\\nhard at me, and I guessed they were the jury. But somehow I didn’t see them as\\nindividuals. I felt as you do just after boarding a streetcar and you’re conscious of all\\nthe people on the opposite seat staring at you in the hope of finding something in\\nyour appearance to amuse them. Of course, I knew this was an absurd comparison;\\nwhat these people were looking for in me wasn’t anything to laugh at, but signs of\\ncriminality. Still, the difference wasn’t so very great, and, anyhow, that’s the idea I\\ngot.\\nWhat with the crowd and the stuffiness of the air I was feeling a bit dizzy. I ran\\nmy eyes round the courtroom but couldn’t recognize any of the faces. At first I could\\nhardly believe that all these people had come on my account. It was such a new\\n52\\n\\n\\n\\nexperience, being a focus of interest; in the ordinary way no one ever paid much\\nattention to me.\\n“What a crush!” I remarked to the policeman on my left, and he explained that the\\nnewspapers were responsible for it.\\nHe pointed to a group of men at a table just below the jury box. “There they are!”\\n“Who?” I asked, and he replied, “The press.” One of them, he added, was an old\\nfriend of his.\\nA moment later the man he’d mentioned looked our way and, coming to the dock,\\nshook hands warmly with the policeman. The journalist was an elderly man with a\\nrather grim expression, but his manner was quite pleasant. Just then I noticed that\\nalmost all the people in the courtroom were greeting each other, exchanging remarks\\nand forming groups—behaving, in fact, as in a club where the company of others of\\none’s own tastes and standing makes one feel at ease. That, no doubt, explained the\\nodd impression I had of being de trop here, a sort of gate-crasher.\\nHowever, the journalist addressed me quite amiably, and said he hoped all would\\ngo well for me. I thanked him, and he added with a smile:\\n“You know, we’ve been featuring you a bit. We’re always rather short of copy in\\nthe summer, and there’s been precious little to write about except your case and the\\none that’s coming on after it. I expect you’ve heard about it; it’s a case of parricide.”\\nHe drew my attention to one of the group at the press table, a plump, small man\\nwith huge black-rimmed glasses, who made me think of an overfed weasel.\\n“That fellow’s the special correspondent of one of the Paris dailies. As a matter of\\nfact, he didn’t come on your account. He was sent for the parricide case, but they’ve\\nasked him to cover yours as well.”\\nIt was on the tip of my tongue to say, “That was very kind of them,” but then I\\nthought it would sound silly. With a friendly wave of his hand he left us, and for\\nsome minutes nothing happened.\\nThen, accompanied by some colleagues, my lawyer bustled in, in his gown. He\\nwent up to the press table and shook hands with the journalists. They remained\\nlaughing and chatting together, all seemingly very much at home here, until a bell\\nrang shrilly and everyone went to his place. My lawyer came up to me, shook hands,\\nand advised me to answer all the questions as briefly as possible, not to volunteer\\ninformation, and to rely on him to see me through.\\nI heard a chair scrape on my left, and a tall, thin man wearing pince-nez settled the\\nfolds of his red gown as he took his seat. The Public Prosecutor, I gathered. A clerk\\nof the court announced that Their Honors were entering, and at the same moment two\\nbig electric fans started buzzing overhead. Three judges, two in black and the third in\\nscarlet, with brief cases under their arms, entered and walked briskly to the bench,\\nwhich was several feet above the level of the courtroom floor. The man in scarlet\\ntook the central, high-backed chair, placed his cap of office on the table, ran a\\n53\\n\\n\\n\\nhandkerchief over his small bald crown, and announced that the hearing would now\\nbegin.\\nThe journalists had their fountain pens ready; they all wore the same expression of\\nslightly ironical indifference, with the exception of one, a much younger man than\\nhis colleagues, in gray flannels with a blue tie, who, leaving his pen on the table, was\\ngazing hard at me. He had a plain, rather chunky face; what held my attention were\\nhis eyes, very pale, clear eyes, riveted on me, though not betraying any definite\\nemotion. For a moment I had an odd impression, as if I were being scrutinized by\\nmyself. That—and the fact that I was unfamiliar with court procedure—may explain\\nwhy I didn’t follow very well the opening phases: the drawing of lots for the jury, the\\nvarious questions put by the presiding judge to the Prosecutor, the foreman of the\\njury, and my counsel (each time he spoke all the jurymen’s heads swung round\\ntogether toward the bench), the hurried reading of the charge sheet, in the course of\\nwhich I recognized some familiar names of people and places; then some\\nsupplementary questions put to my lawyer.\\nNext, the Judge announced that the court would call over the witness list. Some of\\nthe names read out by the clerk rather surprised me. From amongst the crowd, which\\nuntil now I had seen as a mere blur of faces, rose, one after the other, Raymond,\\nMasson, Salamano, the doorkeeper from the Home, old Pérez, and Marie, who gave\\nme a little nervous wave of her hand before following the others out by a side door. I\\nwas thinking how strange it was I hadn’t noticed any of them before when I heard the\\nlast name called, that of Céleste. As he rose, I noticed beside him the quaint little\\nwoman with a mannish coat and brisk, decided air, who had shared my table at the\\nrestaurant. She had her eyes fixed on me, I noticed. But I hadn’t time to wonder\\nabout her; the Judge had started speaking again.\\nHe said that the trial proper was about to begin, and he need hardly say that he\\nexpected the public to refrain from any demonstration whatsoever. He explained that\\nhe was there to supervise the proceedings, as a sort of umpire, and he would take a\\nscrupulously impartial view of the case. The verdict of the jury would be interpreted\\nby him in a spirit of justice. Finally, at the least sign of a disturbance he would have\\nthe court cleared.\\nThe day was stoking up. Some of the public were fanning themselves with\\nnewspapers, and there was a constant rustle of crumpled paper. On a sign from the\\npresiding judge the clerk of the court brought three fans of plaited straw, which the\\nthree judges promptly put in action.\\nMy examination began at once. The Judge questioned me quite calmly and even, I\\nthought, with a hint of cordiality. For the nth time I was asked to give particulars of\\nmy identity and, though heartily sick of this formality, I realized that it was natural\\nenough; after all, it would be a shocking thing for the court to be trying the wrong\\nman.\\n54\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Judge then launched into an account of what I’d done, stopping after every\\ntwo or three sentences to ask me, “Is that correct?” To which I always replied, “Yes,\\nsir,” as my lawyer had advised me. It was a long business, as the Judge lingered on\\neach detail. Meanwhile the journalists scribbled busily away. But I was sometimes\\nconscious of the eyes of the youngest fixed on me; also those of the queer little robot\\nwoman. The jurymen, however, were all gazing at the red-robed judge, and I was\\nagain reminded of the row of passengers on one side of a tram. Presently he gave a\\nslight cough, turned some pages of his file, and, still fanning his face, addressed me\\ngravely.\\nHe now proposed, he said, to trench on certain matters which, on a superficial\\nview, might seem foreign to the case, but actually were highly relevant. I guessed\\nthat he was going to talk about Mother, and at the same moment realized how odious\\nI would find this. His first question was: Why had I sent my mother to an institution?\\nI replied that the reason was simple; I hadn’t enough money to see that she was\\nproperly looked after at home. Then he asked if the parting hadn’t caused me\\ndistress. I explained that neither Mother nor I expected much of one another—or, for\\nthat matter, of anybody else; so both of us had got used to the new conditions easily\\nenough. The Judge then said that he had no wish to press the point, and asked the\\nProsecutor if he could think of any more questions that should be put to me at this\\nstage.\\nThe Prosecutor, who had his back half turned to me, said, without looking in my\\ndirection, that, subject to His Honor’s approval, he would like to know if I’d gone\\nback to the stream with the intention of killing the Arab. I said, “No.” In that case,\\nwhy had I taken a revolver with me, and why go back precisely to that spot? I said it\\nwas a matter of pure chance. The Prosecutor then observed in a nasty tone: “Very\\ngood. That will be all for the present.”\\nI couldn’t quite follow what came next. Anyhow, after some palavering among the\\nbench, the Prosecutor, and my counsel, the presiding judge announced that the court\\nwould now rise; there was an adjournment till the afternoon, when evidence would\\nbe taken.\\nAlmost before I knew what was happening I was rushed out to the prison van,\\nwhich drove me back, and I was given my midday meal. After a short time, just\\nenough for me to realize how tired I was feeling, they came for me. I was back in the\\nsame room, confronting the same faces, and the whole thing started again. But the\\nheat had meanwhile much increased, and by some miracle fans had been procured\\nfor everyone: the jury, my lawyer, the Prosecutor, and some of the journalists, too.\\nThe young man and the robot woman were still at their places. But they were not\\nfanning themselves and, as before, they never took their eyes off me.\\nI wiped the sweat from my face, but I was barely conscious of where or who I was\\nuntil I heard the warden of the Home called to the witness box. When asked if my\\n55\\n\\n\\n\\nmother had complained about my conduct, he said, “Yes,” but that didn’t mean\\nmuch; almost all the inmates of the Home had grievances against their relatives. The\\nJudge asked him to be more explicit; did she reproach me with having sent her to the\\nHome, and he said, “Yes,” again. But this time he didn’t qualify his answer.\\nTo another question he replied that on the day of the funeral he was somewhat\\nsurprised by my calmness. Asked to explain what he meant by “my calmness,” the\\nwarden lowered his eyes and stared at his shoes for a moment. Then he explained\\nthat I hadn’t wanted to see Mother’s body, or shed a single tear, and that I’d left\\nimmediately the funeral ended, without lingering at her grave. Another thing had\\nsurprised him. One of the undertaker’s men told him that I didn’t know my mother’s\\nage. There was a short silence; then the Judge asked him if he might take it that he\\nwas referring to the prisoner in the dock. The warden seemed puzzled by this, and the\\nJudge explained: “It’s a formal question. I am bound to put it.”\\nThe Prosecutor was then asked if he had any questions to put, and he answered\\nloudly: “Certainly not! I have all I want.” His tone and the look of triumph on his\\nface, as he glanced at me, were so marked that I felt as I hadn’t felt for ages. I had a\\nfoolish desire to burst into tears. For the first time I’d realized how all these people\\nloathed me.\\nAfter asking the jury and my lawyer if they had any questions, the Judge heard the\\ndoorkeeper’s evidence. On stepping into the box the man threw a glance at me, then\\nlooked away. Replying to questions, he said that I’d declined to see Mother’s body,\\nI’d smoked cigarettes and slept, and drunk café au lait. It was then I felt a sort of\\nwave of indignation spreading through the courtroom, and for the first time I\\nunderstood that I was guilty. They got the doorkeeper to repeat what he had said\\nabout the coffee and my smoking.\\nThe Prosecutor turned to me again, with a gloating look in his eyes. My counsel\\nasked the doorkeeper if he, too, hadn’t smoked. But the Prosecutor took strong\\nexception to this. “I’d like to know,” he cried indignantly, “who is on trial in this\\ncourt. Or does my friend think that by aspersing a witness for the prosecution he will\\nshake the evidence, the abundant and cogent evidence, against his client?” None the\\nless, the Judge told the doorkeeper to answer the question.\\nThe old fellow fidgeted a bit. Then, “Well, I know I didn’t ought to have done it,”\\nhe mumbled, “but I did take a cigarette from the young gentleman when he offered\\nit—just out of politeness.”\\nThe Judge asked me if I had any comment to make. “None,” I said, “except that\\nthe witness is quite right. It’s true I offered him a cigarette.”\\nThe doorkeeper looked at me with surprise and a sort of gratitude. Then, after\\nhemming and hawing for a bit, he volunteered the statement that it was he who’d\\nsuggested I should have some coffee.\\n\\n56\\n\\n\\n\\nMy lawyer was exultant. “The jury will appreciate,” he said, “the importance of\\nthis admission.”\\nThe Prosecutor, however, was promptly on his feet again. “Quite so,” he boomed\\nabove our heads. “The jury will appreciate it. And they will draw the conclusion that,\\nthough a third party might inadvertently offer him a cup of coffee, the prisoner, in\\ncommon decency, should have refused it, if only out of respect for the dead body of\\nthe poor woman who had brought him into the world.”\\nAfter which the doorkeeper went back to his seat.\\nWhen Thomas Pérez was called, a court officer had. to help him to the box. Pérez\\nstated that, though he had been a great friend of my mother, he had met me once\\nonly, on the day of the funeral. Asked how I had behaved that day, he said:\\n“Well, I was most upset, you know. Far too much upset to notice things. My grief\\nsort of blinded me, I think. It had been a great shock, my dear friend’s death; in fact,\\nI fainted during the funeral. So I didn’t hardly notice the young gentleman at all.”\\nThe Prosecutor asked him to tell the court if he’d seen me weep. And when Pérez\\nanswered, “No,” added emphatically: “I trust the jury will take note of this reply.”\\nMy lawyer rose at once, and asked Pérez in a tone that seemed to me needlessly\\naggressive:\\n“Now, think well, my man! Can you swear you saw he didn’t shed a tear?”\\nPérez answered, “No.”\\nAt this some people tittered, and my lawyer, pushing back one sleeve of his gown,\\nsaid sternly:\\n“That is typical of the way this case is being conducted. No attempt is being made\\nto elicit the true facts.”\\nThe Prosecutor ignored this remark; he was making dabs with his pencil on the\\ncover of his brief, seemingly quite indifferent.\\nThere was a break of five minutes, during which my lawyer told me the case was\\ngoing very well indeed. Then Céleste was called. He was announced as a witness for\\nthe defense. The defense meant me.\\nNow and again Céleste threw me a glance; he kept squeezing his Panama hat\\nbetween his hands as he gave evidence. He was in his best suit, the one he wore\\nwhen sometimes of a Sunday he went with me to the races. But evidently he hadn’t\\nbeen able to get his collar on; the top of his shirt, I noticed, was secured only by a\\nbrass stud. Asked if I was one of his customers, he said, “Yes, and a friend as well.”\\nAsked to state his opinion of me, he said that I was “all right” and, when told to\\nexplain what he meant by that, he replied that everyone knew what that meant. “Was\\nI a secretive sort of man?” “No,” he answered, “I shouldn’t call him that. But he isn’t\\none to waste his breath, like a lot of folks.”\\nThe Prosecutor asked him if I always settled my monthly bill at his restaurant\\nwhen he presented it. Céleste laughed. “Oh, he paid on the nail, all right. But the bills\\n57\\n\\n\\n\\nwere just details-like, between him and me.” Then he was asked to say what he\\nthought about the crime. He placed his hands on the rail of the box and one could see\\nhe had a speech all ready.\\n“To my mind it was just an accident, or a stroke of bad luck, if you prefer. And a\\nthing like that takes you off your guard.”\\nHe wanted to continue, but the Judge cut him short. “Quite so. That’s all, thank\\nyou.”\\nFor a bit Céleste seemed flabbergasted; then he explained that he hadn’t finished\\nwhat he wanted to say. They told him to continue, but to make it brief.\\nHe only repeated that it was “just an accident.”\\n“That’s as it may be,” the Judge observed. “But what we are here for is to try such\\naccidents, according to law. You can stand down.”\\nCéleste turned and gazed at me. His eyes were moist and his lips trembling. It was\\nexactly as if he’d said: “Well, I’ve done my best for you, old man. I’m afraid it\\nhasn’t helped much. I’m sorry.”\\nI didn’t say anything, or make any movement, but for the first time in my life I\\nwanted to kiss a man.\\nThe Judge repeated his order to stand down, and Céleste returned to his place\\namongst the crowd. During the rest of the hearing he remained there, leaning\\nforward, elbows on knees and his Panama between his hands, not missing a word of\\nthe proceedings.\\nIt was Marie’s turn next. She had a hat on and still looked quite pretty, though I\\nmuch preferred her with her hair free. From where I was I had glimpses of the soft\\ncurve of her breasts, and her underlip had the little pout that always fascinated me.\\nShe appeared very nervous.\\nThe first question was: How long had she known me? Since the time when she\\nwas in our office, she replied. Then the Judge asked her what were the relations\\nbetween us, and she said she was my girl friend. Answering another question, she\\nadmitted promising to marry me. The Prosecutor, who had been studying a document\\nin front of him, asked her rather sharply when our “liaison” had begun. She gave the\\ndate. He then observed with a would-be casual air that apparently she meant the day\\nfollowing my mother’s funeral. After letting this sink in he remarked in a slightly\\nironic tone that obviously this was a “delicate topic” and he could enter into the\\nyoung lady’s feelings, but—and here his voice grew sterner—his duty obliged him to\\nwaive considerations of delicacy.\\nAfter making this announcement he asked Marie to give a full account of our\\ndoings on the day when I had “intercourse” with her for the first time. Marie\\nwouldn’t answer at first, but the Prosecutor insisted, and then she told him that we\\nhad met at the baths, gone together to the pictures, and then to my place. He then\\ninformed the court that, as a result of certain statements made by Marie at the\\n58\\n\\n\\n\\nproceedings before the magistrate, he had studied the movie programs of that date,\\nand turning to Marie asked her to name the film that we had gone to see. In a very\\nlow voice she said it was a picture with Fernandel in it. By the time she had finished,\\nthe courtroom was so still you could have heard a pin drop.\\nLooking very grave, the Prosecutor drew himself up to his full height and,\\npointing at me, said in such a tone that I could have sworn he was genuinely moved:\\n“Gentlemen of the jury, I would have you note that on the next day after his\\nmother’s funeral that man was visiting the swimming pool, starting a liaison with a\\ngirl, and going to see a comic film. That is all I wish to say.”\\nWhen he sat down there was the same dead silence. Then all of a sudden Marie\\nburst into tears. He’d got it all wrong, she said; it wasn’t a bit like that really, he’d\\nbullied her into saying the opposite of what she meant. She knew me very well, and\\nshe was sure I hadn’t done anything really wrong—and so on. At a sign from the\\npresiding judge, one of the court officers led her away, and the hearing continued.\\nHardly anyone seemed to listen to Masson, the next witness. He stated that I was a\\nrespectable young fellow; “and, what’s more, a very decent chap.” Nor did they pay\\nany more attention to Salamano, when he told them how kind I’d always been to his\\ndog, or when, in answer to a question about my mother and myself, he said that\\nMother and I had very little in common and that explained why I’d fixed up for her\\nto enter the Home. “You’ve got to understand,” he added. “You’ve got to\\nunderstand.” But no one seemed to understand. He was told to stand down.\\nRaymond was the next, and last, witness. He gave me a little wave of his hand and\\nled off by saying I was innocent. The Judge rebuked him.\\n“You are here to give evidence, not your views on the case, and you must confine\\nyourself to answering the questions put you.”\\nHe was then asked to make clear his relations with the deceased, and Raymond\\ntook this opportunity of explaining that it was he, not I, against whom the dead man\\nhad a grudge, because he, Raymond, had beaten up his sister. The judge asked him if\\nthe deceased had no reason to dislike me, too. Raymond told him that my presence\\non the beach that morning was a pure coincidence.\\n“How comes it then,” the Prosecutor inquired, “that the letter which led up to this\\ntragedy was the prisoner’s work?”\\nRaymond replied that this, too, was due to mere chance.\\nTo which the Prosecutor retorted that in this case “chance” or “mere coincidence”\\nseemed to play a remarkably large part. Was it by chance that I hadn’t intervened\\nwhen Raymond assaulted his mistress? Did this convenient term “chance” account\\nfor my having vouched for Raymond at the police station and having made, on that\\noccasion, statements extravagantly favorable to him? In conclusion he asked\\nRaymond to state what were his means of livelihood.\\n\\n59\\n\\n\\n\\nOn his describing himself as a warehouseman, the Prosecutor informed the jury it\\nwas common knowledge that the witness lived on the immoral earnings of women. I,\\nhe said, was this man’s intimate friend and associate; in fact, the whole background\\nof the crime was of the most squalid description. And what made it even more odious\\nwas the personality of the prisoner, an inhuman monster wholly without a moral\\nsense.\\nRaymond began to expostulate, and my lawyer, too, protested. They were told that\\nthe Prosecutor must be allowed to finish his remarks.\\n“I have nearly done,” he said; then turned to Raymond. “Was the prisoner your\\nfriend?”\\n“Certainly. We were the best of pals, as they say.”\\nThe Prosecutor then put me the same question. I looked hard at Raymond, and he\\ndid not turn away.\\nThen, “Yes,” I answered.\\nThe Prosecutor turned toward the jury.\\n“Not only did the man before you in the dock indulge in the most shameful orgies\\non the day following his mother’s death. He killed a man cold-bloodedly, in\\npursuance of some sordid vendetta in the underworld of prostitutes and pimps. That,\\ngentlemen of the jury, is the type of man the prisoner is.”\\nNo sooner had he sat down than my lawyer, out of all patience, raised his arms so\\nhigh that his sleeves fell back, showing the full length of his starched shirt cuffs.\\n“Is my client on trial for having buried his mother, or for killing a man?” he asked.\\nThere were some titters in court. But then the Prosecutor sprang to his feet and,\\ndraping his gown round him, said he was amazed at his friend’s ingenuousness in\\nfailing to see that between these two elements of the case there was a vital link. They\\nhung together psychologically, if he might put it so. “In short,” he concluded,\\nspeaking with great vehemence, “I accuse the prisoner of behaving at his mother’s\\nfuneral in a way that showed he was already a criminal at heart.”\\nThese words seemed to take much effect on the jury and public. My lawyer merely\\nshrugged his shoulders and wiped the sweat from his forehead. But obviously he was\\nrattled, and I had a feeling things weren’t going well for me.\\nSoon after this incident the court rose. As I was being taken from the courthouse to\\nthe prison van, I was conscious for a few brief moments of the once familiar feel of a\\nsummer evening out-of-doors. And, sitting in the darkness of my moving cell, I\\nrecognized, echoing in my tired brain, all the characteristic sounds of a town I’d\\nloved, and of a certain hour of the day which I had always particularly enjoyed. The\\nshouts of newspaper boys in the already languid air, the last calls of birds in the\\npublic garden, the cries of sandwich vendors, the screech of streetcars at the steep\\ncorners of the upper town, and that faint rustling overhead as darkness sifted down\\n\\n60\\n\\n\\n\\nupon the harbor—all these sounds made my return to prison like a blind man’s\\njourney along a route whose every inch he knows by heart.\\nYes, this was the evening hour when—how long ago it seemed!—I always felt so\\nwell content with life. Then, what awaited me was a night of easy, dreamless sleep.\\nThis was the same hour, but with a difference; I was returning to a cell, and what\\nawaited me was a night haunted by forebodings of the coming day. And so I learned\\nthat familiar paths traced in the dusk of summer evenings may lead as well to prisons\\nas to innocent, untroubled sleep.\\n\\n61\\n\\n\\n\\nIV\\nIT is always interesting, even in the prisoner’s dock, to hear oneself being talked\\nabout. And certainly in the speeches of my lawyer and the prosecuting counsel a\\ngreat deal was said about me; more, in fact, about me personally than about my\\ncrime.\\nReally there wasn’t any very great difference between the two speeches. Counsel\\nfor the defense raised his arms to heaven and pleaded guilty, but with extenuating\\ncircumstances. The Prosecutor made similar gestures; he agreed that I was guilty, but\\ndenied extenuating circumstances.\\nOne thing about this phase of the trial was rather irksome. Quite often, interested\\nas I was in what they had to say, I was tempted to put in a word, myself. But my\\nlawyer had advised me not to. “You won’t do your case any good by talking,” he had\\nwarned me. In fact, there seemed to be a conspiracy to exclude me from the\\nproceedings; I wasn’t to have any say and my fate was to be decided out of hand.\\nIt was quite an effort at times for me to refrain from cutting them all short, and\\nsaying: “But, damn it all, who’s on trial in this court, I’d like to know? It’s a serious\\nmatter for a man, being accused of murder. And I’ve something really important to\\ntell you.”\\nHowever, on second thoughts, I found I had nothing to say. In any case, I must\\nadmit that hearing oneself talked about loses its interest very soon. The Prosecutor’s\\nspeech, especially, began to bore me before he was halfway through it. The only\\nthings that really caught my attention were occasional phrases, his gestures, and\\nsome elaborate tirades—but these were isolated patches.\\nWhat he was aiming at, I gathered, was to show that my crime was premeditated. I\\nremember his saying at one moment, “I can prove this, gentlemen of the jury, to the\\nhilt. First, you have the facts of the crime; which are as clear as daylight. And then\\nyou have what I may call the night side of this case, the dark workings of a criminal\\nmentality.”\\nHe began by summing up the facts, from my mother’s death onward. He stressed\\nmy heartlessness, my inability to state Mother’s age, my visit to the swimming pool\\nwhere I met Marie, our matinee at the pictures where a Fernandel film was showing,\\nand finally my return with Marie to my rooms. I didn’t quite follow his remarks at\\nfirst, as he kept on mentioning “the prisoner’s mistress,” whereas for me she was just\\n“Marie.” Then he came to the subject of Raymond. It seemed to me that his way of\\ntreating the facts showed a certain shrewdness. All he said sounded quite plausible.\\nI’d written the letter in collusion with Raymond so as to entice his mistress to his\\nroom and subject her to ill-treatment by a man “of more than dubious reputation.”\\nThen, on the beach, I’d provoked a brawl with Raymond’s enemies, in the course of\\n62\\n\\n\\n\\nwhich Raymond was wounded. I’d asked him for his revolver and gone back by\\nmyself with the intention of using it. Then I’d shot the Arab. After the first shot I\\nwaited. Then, “to be certain of making a good job of it,” I fired four more shots\\ndeliberately, point-blank, and in cold blood, at my victim.\\n“That is my case,” he said. “I have described to you the series of events which led\\nthis man to kill the deceased, fully aware of what he was doing. I emphasize this\\npoint. We are not concerned with an act of homicide committed on a sudden impulse\\nwhich might serve as extenuation. I ask you to note, gentlemen of the jury, that the\\nprisoner is an educated man. You will have observed the way in which he answered\\nmy questions; he is intelligent and he knows the value of words. And I repeat that it\\nis quite impossible to assume that, when he committed the crime, he was unaware\\nwhat he was doing.”\\nI noticed that he laid stress on my “intelligence.” It puzzled me rather why what\\nwould count as a good point in an ordinary person should be used against an accused\\nman as an overwhelming proof of his guilt. While thinking this over, I missed what\\nhe said next, until I heard him exclaim indignantly: “And has he uttered a word of\\nregret for his most odious crime? Not one word, gentlemen. Not once in the course of\\nthese proceedings did this man show the least contrition.”\\nTurning toward the dock, he pointed a finger at me, and went on in the same\\nstrain. I really couldn’t understand why he harped on this point so much. Of course, I\\nhad to own that he was right; I didn’t feel much regret for what I’d done. Still, to my\\nmind he overdid it, and I’d have liked to have a chance of explaining to him, in a\\nquite friendly, almost affectionate way, that I have never been able really to regret\\nanything in all my life. I’ve always been far too much absorbed in the present\\nmoment, or the immediate future, to think back. Of course, in the position into which\\nI had been forced, there was no question of my speaking to anyone in that tone. I\\nhadn’t the right to show any friendly feeling or possess good intentions. And I tried\\nto follow what came next, as the Prosecutor was now considering what he called my\\n“soul.”\\nHe said he’d studied it closely—and had found a blank, “literally nothing,\\ngentlemen of the jury.” Really, he said, I had no soul, there was nothing human about\\nme, not one of those moral qualities which normal men possess had any place in my\\nmentality. “No doubt,” he added, “we should not reproach him with this. We cannot\\nblame a man for lacking what it was never in his power to acquire. But in a criminal\\ncourt the wholly passive ideal of tolerance must give place to a sterner, loftier ideal,\\nthat of justice. Especially when this lack of every decent instinct is such as that of the\\nman before you, a menace to society.” He proceeded to discuss my conduct toward\\nmy mother, repeating what he had said in the course of the hearing. But he spoke at\\nmuch greater length of my crime—at such length, indeed, that I lost the thread and\\nwas conscious only of the steadily increasing heat.\\n63\\n\\n\\n\\nA moment came when the Prosecutor paused and, after a short silence, said in a\\nlow, vibrant voice: “This same court, gentlemen, will be called on to try tomorrow\\nthat most odious of crimes, the murder of a father by his son.” To his mind, such a\\ncrime was almost unimaginable. But, he ventured to hope, justice would be meted\\nout without paltering. And yet, he made bold to say, the horror that even the crime of\\nparricide inspired in him paled beside the loathing inspired by my callousness.\\n“This man, who is morally guilty of his mother’s death, is no less unfit to have a\\nplace in the community than that other man who did to death the father that begat\\nhim. And, indeed, the one crime led on to the other; the first of these two criminals,\\nthe man in the dock, set a precedent, if I may put it so, and authorized the second\\ncrime. Yes, gentlemen, I am convinced”—here he raised his voice a tone—“that you\\nwill not find I am exaggerating the case against the prisoner when I say that he is also\\nguilty of the murder to be tried tomorrow in this court. And I look to you for a\\nverdict accordingly.”\\nThe Prosecutor paused again, to wipe the sweat off his face. He then explained\\nthat his duty was a painful one, but he would do it without flinching. “This man has,\\nI repeat, no place in a community whose basic principles he flouts without\\ncompunction. Nor, heartless as he is, has he any claim to mercy. I ask you to impose\\nthe extreme penalty of the law; and I ask it without a qualm. In the course of a long\\ncareer, in which it has often been my duty to ask for a capital sentence, never have I\\nfelt that painful duty weigh so little on my mind as in the present case. In demanding\\na verdict of murder without extenuating circumstances, I am following not only the\\ndictates of my conscience and a sacred obligation, but also those of the natural and\\nrighteous indignation I feel at the sight of a criminal devoid of the least spark of\\nhuman feeling.”\\nWhen the Prosecutor sat down there was a longish silence. Personally I was quite\\novercome by the heat and my amazement at what I had been hearing. The presiding\\njudge gave a short cough, and asked me in a very low tone if I had anything to say. I\\nrose, and as I felt in the mood to speak, I said the first thing that crossed my mind:\\nthat I’d had no intention of killing the Arab. The Judge replied that this statement\\nwould be taken into consideration by the court. Meanwhile he would be glad to hear,\\nbefore my counsel addressed the court, what were the motives of my crime. So far,\\nhe must admit, he hadn’t fully understood the grounds of my defense.\\nI tried to explain that it was because of the sun, but I spoke too quickly and ran my\\nwords into each other. I was only too conscious that it sounded nonsensical, and, in\\nfact, I heard people tittering.\\nMy lawyer shrugged his shoulders. Then he was directed to address the court, in\\nhis turn. But all he did was to point out the lateness of the hour and to ask for an\\nadjournment till the following afternoon. To this the judge agreed.\\n\\n64\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I was brought back next day, the electric fans were still churning up the\\nheavy air and the jurymen plying their gaudy little fans in a sort of steady rhythm.\\nThe speech for the defense seemed to me interminable. At one moment, however, I\\npricked up my ears; it was when I heard him saying: “It is true I killed a man.” He\\nwent on in the same strain, saying “I” when he referred to me. It seemed so queer\\nthat I bent toward the policeman on my right and asked him to explain. He told me to\\nshut up; then, after a moment, whispered: “They all do that.” It seemed to me that the\\nidea behind it was still further to exclude me from the case, to put me off the map. so\\nto speak, by substituting the lawyer for myself. Anyway, it hardly mattered; I already\\nfelt worlds away from this courtroom and its tedious “proceedings.”\\nMy lawyer, in any case, struck me as feeble to the point of being ridiculous. He\\nhurried through his plea of provocation, and then he, too, started in about my soul.\\nBut I had an impression that he had much less talent than the Prosecutor.\\n“I, too,” he said, “have closely studied this man’s soul; but, unlike my learned\\nfriend for the prosecution, I have found something there. Indeed, I may say that I\\nhave read the prisoner’s mind like an open book.” What he had read there was that I\\nwas an excellent young fellow, a steady, conscientious worker who did his best by\\nhis employer; that I was popular with everyone and sympathetic in others’ troubles.\\nAccording to him I was a dutiful son, who had supported his mother as long as he\\nwas able. After anxious consideration I had reached the conclusion that, by entering a\\nhome, the old lady would have comforts that my means didn’t permit me to provide\\nfor her. “I am astounded, gentlemen,” he added, “by the attitude taken up by my\\nlearned friend in referring to this Home. Surely if proof be needed of the excellence\\nof such institutions, we need only remember that they are promoted and financed by\\na government department.” I noticed that he made no reference to the funeral, and\\nthis seemed to me a serious omission. But, what with his long-windedness, the\\nendless days and hours they had been discussing my “soul,” and the rest of it, I found\\nthat my mind had gone blurred; everything was dissolving into a grayish, watery\\nhaze.\\nOnly one incident stands out; toward the end, while my counsel rambled on, I\\nheard the tin trumpet of an ice-cream vendor in the street, a small, shrill sound\\ncutting across the flow of words. And then a rush of memories went through my\\nmind—memories of a life which was mine no longer and had once provided me with\\nthe surest, humblest pleasures: warm smells of summer, my favorite streets, the sky\\nat evening, Marie’s dresses and her laugh. The futility of what was happening here\\nseemed to take me by the throat, I felt like vomiting, and I had only one idea: to get it\\nover, to go back to my cell, and sleep ... and sleep.\\nDimly I heard my counsel making his last appeal.\\n“Gentlemen of the jury, surely you will not send to his death a decent, hardworking young man, because for one tragic moment he lost his self-control? Is he not\\n65\\n\\n\\n\\nsufficiently punished by the lifelong remorse that is to be his lot? I confidently await\\nyour verdict, the only verdict possible—that of homicide with extenuating\\ncircumstances.”\\nThe court rose, and the lawyer sat down, looking thoroughly exhausted. Some of\\nhis colleagues came to him and shook his hand. “You put up a magnificent show, old\\nman,” I heard one of them say. Another lawyer even called me to witness: “Fine,\\nwasn’t it?” I agreed, but insincerely; I was far too tired to judge if it had been “fine”\\nor otherwise.\\nMeanwhile the day was ending and the heat becoming less intense. By some vague\\nsounds that reached me from the street I knew that the cool of the evening had set in.\\nWe all sat on, waiting. And what we all were waiting for really concerned nobody\\nbut me. I looked round the courtroom. It was exactly as it had been on the first day. I\\nmet the eyes of the journalist in gray and the robot woman. This reminded me that\\nnot once during the whole hearing had I tried to catch Marie’s eye. It wasn’t that I’d\\nforgotten her; only I was too preoccupied. I saw her now, seated between Céleste and\\nRaymond. She gave me a little wave of her hand, as if to say, “At last!” She was\\nsmiling, but I could tell that she was rather anxious. But my heart seemed turned to\\nstone, and I couldn’t even return her smile.\\nThe judges came back to their seats. Someone read out to the jury, very rapidly, a\\nstring of questions. I caught a word here and there. “Murder of malice aforethought\\n... Provocation ... Extenuating circumstances.” The jury went out, and I was taken to\\nthe little room where I had already waited. My lawyer came to see me; he was very\\ntalkative and showed more cordiality and confidence than ever before. He assured\\nme that all would go well and I’d get off with a few years’ imprisonment or\\ntransportation. I asked him what were the chances of getting the sentence quashed.\\nHe said there was no chance of that. He had not raised any point of law, as this was\\napt to prejudice the jury. And it was difficult to get a judgment quashed except on\\ntechnical grounds. I saw his point, and agreed. Looking at the matter dispassionately,\\nI shared his view. Otherwise there would be no end to litigation. “In any case,” the\\nlawyer said, “you can appeal in the ordinary way. But I’m convinced the verdict will\\nbe favorable.”\\nWe waited for quite a while, a good three quarters of an hour, I should say. Then a\\nbell rang. My lawyer left me, saying:\\n“The foreman of the jury will read out the answers. You will be called on after that\\nto hear the judgment.”\\nSome doors banged. I heard people hurrying down flights of steps, but couldn’t\\ntell whether they were near by or distant. Then I heard a voice droning away in the\\ncourtroom.\\nWhen the bell rang again and I stepped back into the dock, the silence of the\\ncourtroom closed in round me, and with the silence came a queer sensation when I\\n66\\n\\n\\n\\nnoticed that, for the. first time, the young journalist kept his eyes averted. I didn’t\\nlook in Marie’s direction. In fact, I had no time to look, as the presiding judge had\\nalready started pronouncing a rigmarole to the effect that “in the name of the French\\npeople” I was to be decapitated in some public place.\\nIt seemed to me then that I could interpret the look on the faces of those present; it\\nwas one of almost respectful sympathy. The policemen, too, handled me very gently.\\nThe lawyer placed his hand on my wrist. I had stopped thinking altogether. I heard\\nthe Judge’s voice asking if I had anything more to say. After thinking for a moment,\\nI answered, “No.” Then the policemen led me out.\\n\\n67\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\nI HAVE just refused, for the third time, to see the prison chaplain. I have nothing to\\nsay to him, don’t feel like talking—and shall be seeing him quite soon enough,\\nanyway. The only thing that interests me now is the problem of circumventing the\\nmachine, learning if the inevitable admits a loophole.\\nThey have moved me to another cell. In this one, lying on my back, I can see the\\nsky, and there is nothing else to see. All my time is spent in watching the slowly\\nchanging colors of the sky, as day moves on to night. I put my hands behind my\\nhead, gaze up, and wait.\\nThis problem of a loophole obsesses me; I am always wondering if there have\\nbeen cases of condemned prisoners’ escaping from the implacable machinery of\\njustice at the last moment, breaking through the police cordon, vanishing in the nick\\nof time before the guillotine falls. Often and often I blame myself for not having\\ngiven more attention to accounts of public executions. One should always take an\\ninterest in such matters. There’s never any knowing what one may come to. Like\\neveryone else I’d read descriptions of executions in the papers. But technical books\\ndealing with this subject must certainly exist; only I’d never felt sufficiently\\ninterested to look them up. And in these books I might have found escape stories.\\nSurely they’d have told me that in one case, anyhow, the wheels had stopped; that\\nonce, if only once, in that inexorable march of events, chance or luck had played a\\nhappy part. Just once! In a way I think that single instance would have satisfied me.\\nMy emotion would have done the rest. The papers often talk of “a debt owed to\\nsociety”—a debt which, according to them, must be paid by the offender. But talk of\\nthat sort doesn’t touch the imagination. No, the one thing that counted for me was the\\npossibility of making a dash for it and defeating their bloodthirsty rite; of a mad\\nstampede to freedom that would anyhow give me a moment’s hope, the gambler’s\\nlast throw. Naturally, all that “hope” could come to was to be knocked down at the\\ncorner of a street or picked off by a bullet in my back. But, all things considered,\\neven this luxury was forbidden me; I was caught in the rattrap irrevocably.\\nTry as I might, I couldn’t stomach this brutal certitude. For really, when one came\\nto think of it, there was a disproportion between the judgment on which it was based\\nand the unalterable sequence of events starting from the moment when that judgment\\nwas delivered. The fact that the verdict was read out at eight P.M. rather than at five,\\nthe fact that it might have been quite different, that it was given by men who change\\ntheir underclothes, and was credited to so vague an entity as the “French people”—\\nfor that matter, why not to the Chinese or the German people?—all these facts\\nseemed to deprive the court’s decision of much of its gravity. Yet I could but\\nrecognize that, from the moment the verdict was given, its effects became as cogent,\\n68\\n\\n\\n\\nas tangible, as, for example, this wall against which I was lying, pressing my back to\\nit.\\nWhen such thoughts crossed my mind, I remembered a story Mother used to tell\\nme about my father. I never set eyes on him. Perhaps the only things I really knew\\nabout him were what Mother had told me. One of these was that he’d gone to see a\\nmurderer executed. The mere thought of it turned his stomach. But he’d seen it\\nthrough and, on coming home, was violently sick. At the time, I found my father’s\\nconduct rather disgusting. But now I understood; it was so natural. How had I failed\\nto recognize that nothing was more important than an execution; that, viewed from\\none angle, it’s the only thing that can genuinely interest a man? And I decided that, if\\never I got out of jail, I’d attend every execution that took place. I was unwise, no\\ndoubt, even to consider this possibility. For, the moment I’d pictured myself in\\nfreedom, standing behind a double rank of policemen—on the right side of the line,\\nso to speak—the mere thought of being an onlooker who comes to see the show, and\\ncan go home and vomit afterward, flooded my mind with a wild, absurd exultation. It\\nwas a stupid thing to let my imagination run away with me like that; a moment later I\\nhad a shivering fit and had to wrap myself closely in my blanket. But my teeth went\\non chattering; nothing would stop them.\\nStill, obviously, one can’t be sensible all the time. Another equally ridiculous\\nfancy of mine was to frame new laws, altering the penalties. What was wanted, to my\\nmind, was to give the criminal a chance, if only a dog’s chance; say, one chance in a\\nthousand. There might be some drug, or combination of drugs, which would kill the\\npatient (I thought of him as “the patient”) nine hundred and ninety times in a\\nthousand. That he should know this was, of course, essential. For after taking much\\nthought, calmly, I came to the conclusion that what was wrong about the guillotine\\nwas that the condemned man had no chance at all, absolutely none. In fact, the\\npatient’s death had been ordained irrevocably. It was a foregone conclusion. If by\\nsome fluke the knife didn’t do its job, they started again. So it came to this, that—\\nagainst the grain, no doubt—the condemned man had to hope the apparatus was in\\ngood working order! This, I thought, was a flaw in the system; and, on the face of it,\\nmy view was sound enough. On the other hand, I had to admit it proved the\\nefficiency of the system. It came to this; the man under sentence was obliged to\\ncollaborate mentally, it was in his interest that all should go off without a hitch.\\nAnother thing I had to recognize was that, until now, I’d had wrong ideas on the\\nsubject. For some reason I’d always supposed that one had to go up steps and climb\\non to a scaffold, to be guillotined. Probably that was because of the 1789 Revolution;\\nI mean, what I’d learned about it at school, and the pictures I had seen. Then one\\nmorning I remembered a photograph the newspapers had featured on the occasion of\\nthe execution of a famous criminal. Actually the apparatus stood on the ground; there\\nwas nothing very impressing about it, and it was much narrower than I’d imagined. It\\n69\\n\\n\\n\\nstruck me as rather odd that picture had escaped my memory until now. What had\\nstruck me at the time was the neat appearance of the guillotine; its shining surfaces\\nand finish reminded me of some laboratory instrument. One always has exaggerated\\nideas about what one doesn’t know. Now I had to admit it seemed a very simple\\nprocess, getting guillotined; the machine is on the same level as the man, and he\\nwalks toward it as he steps forward to meet somebody he knows. In a sense, that, too,\\nwas disappointing. The business of climbing a scaffold, leaving the world below, so\\nto speak, gave something for a man’s imagination to get hold of. But, as it was, the\\nmachine dominated everything; they killed you discreetly, with a hint of shame and\\nmuch efficiency.\\nThere were two other things about which I was always thinking: the dawn and my\\nappeal. However, I did my best to keep my mind off these thoughts. I lay down,\\nlooked up at the sky, and forced myself to study it. When the light began to turn\\ngreen I knew that night was coming. Another thing I did to deflect the course of my\\nthoughts was to listen to my heart. I couldn’t imagine that this faint throbbing which\\nhad been with me for so long would ever cease. Imagination has never been one of\\nmy strong points. Still, I tried to picture a moment when the beating of my heart no\\nlonger echoed in my head. But, in vain. The dawn and my appeal were still there.\\nAnd I ended by believing it was a silly thing to try to force one’s thoughts out of\\ntheir natural groove.\\nThey always came for one at dawn; that much I knew. So, really, all my nights\\nwere spent in waiting for that dawn. I have never liked being taken by surprise.\\nWhen something happens to me I want to be ready for it. That’s why I got into the\\nhabit of sleeping off and on in the daytime and watching through the night for the\\nfirst hint of daybreak in the dark dome above. The worst period of the night was that\\nvague hour when, I knew, they usually come; once it was after midnight I waited,\\nlistening intently. Never before had my ears perceived so many noises, such tiny\\nsounds. Still, I must say I was lucky in one respect; never during any of those periods\\ndid I hear footsteps. Mother used to say that however miserable one is, there’s\\nalways something to be thankful for. And each morning, when the sky brightened\\nand light began to flood my cell, I agreed with her. Because I might just as well have\\nheard footsteps, and felt my heart shattered into bits. Even though the faintest rustle\\nsent me hurrying to the door and, pressing an ear to the rough, cold wood, I listened\\nso intently that I could hear my breathing, quick and hoarse like a dog’s panting—\\neven so there was an end; my heart hadn’t split, and I knew I had another twenty-four\\nhours’ respite.\\nThen all day there was my appeal to think about. I made the most of this idea,\\nstudying my effects so as to squeeze out the maximum of consolation. Thus, I always\\nbegan by assuming the worst; my appeal was dismissed. That meant, of course, I was\\nto die. Sooner than others, obviously. “But,” I reminded myself, “it’s common\\n70\\n\\n\\n\\nknowledge that life isn’t worth living, anyhow.” And, on a wide view, I could see\\nthat it makes little difference whether one dies at the age of thirty or threescore and\\nten—since, in either case, other men and women will continue living, the world will\\ngo on as before. Also, whether I died now or forty years hence, this business of dying\\nhad to be got through, inevitably. Still, somehow this line of thought wasn’t as\\nconsoling as it should have been; the idea of all those years of life in hand was a\\ngalling reminder! However, I could argue myself out of it, by picturing what would\\nhave been my feelings when my term was up, and death had cornered me. Once\\nyou’re up against it, the precise manner of your death has obviously small\\nimportance. Therefore—but it was hard not to lose the thread of the argument\\nleading up to that “therefore”—I should be prepared to face the dismissal of my\\nappeal.\\nAt this stage, but only at this stage, I had, so to speak, the right, and accordingly I\\ngave myself leave, to consider the other alternative; that my appeal was successful.\\nAnd then the trouble was to calm down that sudden rush of joy racing through my\\nbody and even bringing tears to my eyes. But it was up to me to bring my nerves to\\nheel and steady my mind; for, even in considering this possibility, I had to keep some\\norder in my thoughts, so as to make my consolations, as regards the first alternative,\\nmore plausible. When I’d succeeded, I had earned a good hour’s peace of mind; and\\nthat, anyhow, was something.\\nIt was at one of these moments that I refused once again to see the chaplain. I was\\nlying down and could mark the summer evening coming on by a soft golden glow\\nspreading across the sky. I had just turned down my appeal, and felt my blood\\ncirculating with slow, steady throbs. No, I didn’t want to see the chaplain. ... Then I\\ndid something I hadn’t done for quite a while; I fell to thinking about Marie. She\\nhadn’t written for ages; probably, I surmised, she had grown tired of being the\\nmistress of a man sentenced to death. Or she might be ill, or dead. After all, such\\nthings happen. How could I have known about it, since, apart from our two bodies,\\nseparated now, there was no link between us, nothing to remind us of each other?\\nSupposing she were dead, her memory would mean nothing; I couldn’t feel an\\ninterest in a dead girl. This seemed to me quite normal; just as I realized people\\nwould soon forget me once I was dead. I couldn’t even say that this was hard to\\nstomach; really, there’s no idea to which one doesn’t get acclimatized in time.\\nMy thoughts had reached this point when the chaplain walked in, unannounced. I\\ncouldn’t help giving a start on seeing him. He noticed this evidently, as he promptly\\ntold me not to be alarmed. I reminded him that usually his visits were at another\\nhour, and for a pretty grim occasion. This, he replied, was just a friendly visit; it had\\nno concern with my appeal, about which he knew nothing. Then he sat down on my\\nbed, asking me to sit beside him. I refused—not because I had anything against him;\\nhe seemed a mild, amiable man.\\n71\\n\\nHe remained quite still at first, his arms resting on his knees, his eyes fixed on his\\nhands. They were slender but sinewy hands, which made me think of two nimble\\nlittle animals. Then he gently rubbed them together. He stayed so long in the same\\nposition that for a while I almost forgot he was there.\\nAll of a sudden he jerked his head up and looked me in the eyes.\\n“Why,” he asked, “don’t you let me come to see you?”\\nI explained that I didn’t believe in God.\\n“Are you really so sure of that?”\\nI said I saw no point in troubling my head about the matter; whether I believed or\\ndidn’t was, to my mind, a question of so little importance.\\nHe then leaned back against the wall, laying his hands flat on his thighs. Almost\\nwithout seeming to address me, he remarked that he’d often noticed one fancies one\\nis quite sure about something, when in point of fact one isn’t. When I said nothing,\\nhe looked at me again, and asked:\\n“Don’t you agree?”\\nI said that seemed quite possible. But, though I mightn’t be so sure about what\\ninterested me, I was absolutely sure about what didn’t interest me. And the question\\nhe had raised didn’t interest me at all.\\nHe looked away and, without altering his posture, asked if it was because I felt\\nutterly desperate that I spoke like this. I explained that it wasn’t despair I felt, but\\nfear—which was natural enough.\\n“In that case,” he said firmly, “God can help you. All the men I’ve seen in your\\nposition turned to Him in their time of trouble.”\\nObviously, I replied, they were at liberty to do so, if they felt like it. I, however,\\ndidn’t want to be helped, and I hadn’t time to work up interest for something that\\ndidn’t interest me.\\nHe fluttered his hands fretfully; then, sitting up, smoothed out his cassock. When\\nthis was done he began talking again, addressing me as “my friend.” It wasn’t\\nbecause I’d been condemned to death, he said, that he spoke to me in this way. In his\\nopinion every man on the earth was under sentence of death.\\nThere, I interrupted him; that wasn’t the same thing, I pointed out, and, what’s\\nmore, could be no consolation.\\nHe nodded. “Maybe. Still, if you don’t die soon, you’ll die one day. And then the\\nsame question will arise. How will you face that terrible, final hour?”\\nI replied that I’d face it exactly as I was facing it now.\\nThereat he stood up, and looked me straight in the eyes. It was a trick I knew well.\\nI used to amuse myself trying it on Emmanuel and Céleste, and nine times out of ten\\nthey’d look away uncomfortably. I could see the chaplain was an old hand at it, as\\nhis gaze never faltered. And his voice was quite steady when he said: “Have you no\\n\\n72\\n\\n\\nhope at all? Do you really think that when you die you die outright, and nothing\\nremains?”\\nI said: “Yes.”\\nHe dropped his eyes and sat down again. He was truly sorry for me, he said. It\\nmust make life unbearable for a man, to think as I did.\\nThe priest was beginning to bore me, and, resting a shoulder on the wall, just\\nbeneath the little skylight, I looked away. Though I didn’t trouble much to follow\\nwhat he said, I gathered he was questioning me again. Presently his tone became\\nagitated, urgent, and, as I realized that he was genuinely distressed, I began to pay\\nmore attention.\\nHe said he felt convinced my appeal would succeed, but I was saddled with a load\\nof guilt, of which I must get rid. In his view man’s justice was a vain thing; only\\nGod’s justice mattered. I pointed out that the former had condemned me. Yes, he\\nagreed, but it hadn’t absolved me from my sin. I told him that I wasn’t conscious of\\nany “sin”; all I knew was that I’d been guilty of a criminal offense. Well, I was\\npaying the penalty of that offense, and no one had the right to expect anything more\\nof me.\\nJust then he got up again, and it struck me that if he wanted to move in this tiny\\ncell, almost the only choice lay between standing up and sitting down. I was staring\\nat the floor. He took a single step toward me, and halted, as if he didn’t dare to come\\nnearer. Then he looked up through the bars at the sky.\\n“You’re mistaken, my son,” he said gravely. “There’s more that might be required\\nof you. And perhaps it will be required of you.”\\n“What do you mean?”\\n“You might be asked to see ...”\\n“To see what?”\\nSlowly the priest gazed round my cell, and I was struck by the sadness of his voice\\nwhen he replied:\\n“These stone walls, I know it only too well, are steeped in human suffering. I’ve\\nnever been able to look at them without a shudder. And yet—believe me, I am\\nspeaking from the depths of my heart—I know that even the wretchedest amongst\\nyou have sometimes seen, taking form against that grayness, a divine face. It’s that\\nface you are asked to see.”\\nThis roused me a little. I informed him that I’d been staring at those walls for\\nmonths; there was nobody, nothing in the world, I knew better than I knew them.\\nAnd once upon a time, perhaps, I used to try to see a face. But it was a sun-gold face,\\nlit up with desire—Marie’s face. I had no luck; I’d never seen it, and now I’d given\\nup trying. Indeed, I’d never seen anything “taking form,” as he called it, against\\nthose gray walls.\\n\\n73\\n\\n\\n\\nThe chaplain gazed at me with a sort of sadness. I now had my back to the wall\\nand light was flowing over my forehead. He muttered some words I didn’t catch;\\nthen abruptly asked if he might kiss me. I said, “No.” Then he turned, came up to the\\nwall, and slowly drew his hand along it.\\n“Do you really love these earthly things so very much?” he asked in a low voice.\\nI made no reply.\\nFor quite a while he kept his eyes averted. His presence was getting more and\\nmore irksome, and I was on the point of telling him to go, and leave me in peace,\\nwhen all of a sudden he swung round on me, and burst out passionately:\\n“No! No! I refuse to believe it. I’m sure you’ve often wished there was an\\nafterlife.”\\nOf course I had, I told him. Everybody has that wish at times. But that had no\\nmore importance than wishing to be rich, or to swim very fast, or to have a bettershaped mouth. It was in the same order of things. I was going on in the same vein,\\nwhen he cut in with a question. How did I picture the life after the grave?\\nI fairly bawled out at him: “A life in which I can remember this life on earth.\\nThat’s all I want of it.” And in the same breath I told him I’d had enough of his\\ncompany.\\nBut, apparently, he had more to say on the subject of God. I went close up to him\\nand made a last attempt to explain that I’d very little time left, and I wasn’t going to\\nwaste it on God.\\nThen he tried to change the subject by asking me why I hadn’t once addressed him\\nas “Father,” seeing that he was a priest. That irritated me still more, and I told him he\\nwasn’t my father; quite the contrary, he was on the others’ side.\\n“No, no, my son,” he said, laying his hand on my shoulder. “I’m on your side,\\nthough you don’t realize it—because your heart is hardened. But I shall pray for\\nyou.”\\nThen, I don’t know how it was, but something seemed to break inside me, and I\\nstarted yelling at the top of my voice. I hurled insults at him, I told him not to waste\\nhis rotten prayers on me; it was better to burn than to disappear. I’d taken him by the\\nneckband of his cassock, and, in a sort of ecstasy of joy and rage, I poured out on\\nhim all the thoughts that had been simmering in my brain. He seemed so cocksure,\\nyou see. And yet none of his certainties was worth one strand of a woman’s hair.\\nLiving as he did, like a corpse, he couldn’t even be sure of being alive. It might look\\nas if my hands were empty. Actually, I was sure of myself, sure about everything, far\\nsurer than he; sure of my present life and of the death that was coming. That, no\\ndoubt, was all I had; but at least that certainty was something I could get my teeth\\ninto—just as it had got its teeth into me. I’d been right, I was still right, I was always\\nright. I’d passed my life in a certain way, and I might have passed it in a different\\nway, if I’d felt like it. I’d acted thus, and I hadn’t acted otherwise; I hadn’t done x,\\n74\\n\\n\\n\\nwhereas I had done y or z. And what did that mean? That, all the time, I’d been\\nwaiting for this present moment, for that dawn, tomorrow’s or another day’s, which\\nwas to justify me. Nothing, nothing had the least importance and I knew quite well\\nwhy. He, too, knew why. From the dark horizon of my future a sort of slow,\\npersistent breeze had been blowing toward me, all my life long, from the years that\\nwere to come. And on its way that breeze had leveled out all the ideas that people\\ntried to foist on me in the equally unreal years I then was living through. What\\ndifference could they make to me, the deaths of others, or a mother’s love, or his\\nGod; or the way a man decides to live, the fate he thinks he chooses, since one and\\nthe same fate was bound to “choose” not only me but thousands of millions of\\nprivileged people who, like him, called themselves my brothers. Surely, surely he\\nmust see that? Every man alive was privileged; there was only one class of men, the\\nprivileged class. All alike would be condemned to die one day; his turn, too, would\\ncome like the others’. And what difference could it make if, after being charged with\\nmurder, he were executed because he didn’t weep at his mother’s funeral, since it all\\ncame to the same thing in the end? The same thing for Salamano’s wife and for\\nSalamano’s dog. That little robot woman was as “guilty” as the girl from Paris who\\nhad married Masson, or as Marie, who wanted me to marry her. What did it matter if\\nRaymond was as much my pal as Céleste, who was a far worthier man? What did it\\nmatter if at this very moment Marie was kissing a new boy friend? As a condemned\\nman himself, couldn’t he grasp what I meant by that dark wind blowing from my\\nfuture? ...\\nI had been shouting so much that I’d lost my breath, and just then the jailers\\nrushed in and started trying to release the chaplain from my grip. One of them made\\nas if to strike me. The chaplain quietened them down, then gazed at me for a moment\\nwithout speaking. I could see tears in his eyes. Then he turned and left the cell.\\nOnce he’d gone, I felt calm again. But all this excitement had exhausted me and I\\ndropped heavily on to my sleeping plank. I must have had a longish sleep, for, when\\nI woke, the stars were shining down on my face. Sounds of the countryside came\\nfaintly in, and the cool night air, veined with smells’ of earth and salt, fanned my\\ncheeks. The marvelous peace of the sleepbound summer night flooded through me\\nlike a tide. Then, just on the edge of daybreak, I heard a steamer’s siren. People were\\nstarting on a voyage to a world which had ceased to concern me forever. Almost for\\nthe first time in many months I thought of my mother. And now, it seemed to me, I\\nunderstood why at her life’s end she had taken on a “fiancé”; why she’d played at\\nmaking a fresh start. There, too, in that Home where lives were flickering out, the\\ndusk came as a mournful solace. With death so near, Mother must have felt like\\nsomeone on the brink of freedom, ready to start life all over again. No one, no one in\\nthe world had any right to weep for her. And I, too, felt ready to start life all over\\nagain. It was as if that great rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope,\\n75\\nand, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the\\nfirst, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe. To feel it so like\\nmyself, indeed, so brotherly, made me realize that I’d been happy, and that I was\\nhappy still. For all to be accomplished, for me to feel less lonely, all that remained to\\nhope was that on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators\\nand that they should greet me with howls of execration.\\nTHE END.\\n\\n76'"
